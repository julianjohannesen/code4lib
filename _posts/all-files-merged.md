<em><strong>We have heard that the conference hotel is now booked full. There are quite a few alternative hotels in Corvallis. One recommended hotel is the <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/ex/1/en/hd/CVOOR">Holiday Inn Express</a>, which is located approximately a mile from the conference site. It also provides free wi-fi access.</strong></em>

<dd>The conference hotel is the <a href="http://www.hiltongardeninn.com/en/gi/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=CVOCHGI">Hilton Garden Inn</a>, located across the street from the LaSells Stewart Center on the OSU Campus. The discounted room rate is $84/night plus tax. To make a reservation, please call 541-752-5000. Please make your reservations by January 14, 2006 in order to ensure that you receive the discounted rate and let the hotel operator know that you are with code4lib 2006.</dd>

<dt><strong>Transportation</strong></dt>

<dd><font color="red">NOTE: You must make reservations to use the shuttle services. Reservations may be made by visiting the appropriate shuttle URL below</font>


Fly into either:

<ul>
<li>Portland Airport (PDX) &#151; There is <a href="http://www.hutshuttle.com/">shuttle service</a> for $43 each way, direct to the hotel. (Choose the 'Corvallis' option from the shuttle website for the shuttle schedule) (Some people have reported that the web site reservation didn't work, and they had to call through.)</li>
<li>Eugene Airport (EUG) &#151; <a href="http://www.oregon.com/transportation/eugene_airport.cfm">shuttle options</a></li>
<li>There is some carpooling [link removed]</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><strong>Types of Activites and Programs</strong></dt>
<dd>
<ul>

<li><em>Keynotes</em> - 45 minutes, talks from the farthernmost reaches of library software development where significant real work is getting done. To provide an opportunity to see where they are up close, to learn details of their implementation choices, to hear about the challenges they're facing and how those might scale/translate to the rest of us.</li>

<li><em>Prepared talks</em> - 20 minutes, which must center on "tools" (some kick-ass new software library or integration platform), "specs" (how to get the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones), or "challenges" (Some Big Problem  we should collectively address). We will evaluate proposals on criteria of geekiness, usefulness, newness, and diversity of topics.</li>

<li><em>Lightning talks</em>  - 5 minutes, those interested sign up on a wiki that opens at the start of the conference.  *Hard* 5 minute limit... at 4 minutes the next person gets up and starts attaching their screen, and somebody keeps a hard count.</li>

<li><em><a href="http://wiki.library.oregonstate.edu/confluence/display/code4lib/Breakout+Session+Ideas">Breakouts</a></em> - People interested in the same project/problem can hang out in a space together for 60-90 minute blocks. Somebody near to the project/problem can coordinate discussion, set up hackers, tackle a challenge session topic, etc. Larger groups will get separate space, smaller groups can just spread out in the larger conference room space.</li>

</ul>

pwyky served us well, and the old wiki is still <a href="/wiki">available</a>....but we all decided it was time to move on to something a bit more featureful. We were trying to conduct a vote using pwyky, and the lack of locking and made the process a bit tricky :-)

<strong>Call for proposals - Code4lib 2006</strong>

We are now accepting proposals for prepared talks for <a href="/conference/2006">Code4lib 2006</a>. Code4lib 2006 is a loosely structured conference for library technologists to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be inspired, and forge collaborations. It is also an outgrowth of the Access HackFest, wrapped into a conference-ish format. It is *the* event for technologists building digital libraries and digital information systems, tools, and software.

At least six time slots will be available for prepared talks. We will choose from among the proposals based on diversity of topics, usefulness, wow factor, and potential impact.

Proposals of 75 words or less are being accepted for review now. Please send your name, email address, and proposal to <a href="mailto:code4libcon@lists.gatech.edu">code4libcon at lists.gatech.edu</a>.

We cannot accept every prepared talk proposal, but multiple lightning talk sessions will provide everyone who wishes to present with ample opportunity to show off. The proposal deadline is 5pm EST January 9, 2006, and proposers will be notified by Midnight January 9, 2006.

<strong>Prepared Talk Information</strong>

Prepared talks are 20 minutes, and must center on "tools" (some cool new software, software library or integration platform), "specs" (how to get the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones), or "challenges" (One or more big problems we should collectively address). We will evaluate proposals on criteria of usefulness, newness, geekiness, and diversity of topics.

Again, proposals should be sent to <a href="mailto:code4libcon@lists.gatech.edu">code4libcon at lists.gatech.edu</a>

The deadline for proposing a talk has been extended one week to Jan. 9. We've already got several very cool proposals but more is better, and there's plenty of room for spillover in the lightning sessions and breakouts.

To submit, <a href="/conference/2006">read this first</a> and then follow <a href="http://www.code4lib.org/proposals">these instructions</a>. Especially the 75-words-max part.

unAPI is a simple-to-use, simple-to-implement API for web sites that allows rich object access and can be easily layered over existing services like Atom, OpenSearch, OAI-PMH, or SRU. OPA is a general-purpose identifier resolver that wraps API calls to heavily-used but incompatible web services like those from Amazon, Flickr, and Pubmed.

Together they will do the same thing we do every code4libcon â€“ try to take over the world!

This talk will discuss the core development activities of the â€œQuality
Metricsâ€ project at Emoryâ€™s Woodruff Library. This project is being
conducted under an IMLS grant to research requirements for and build
a working prototype digital library search system.

What this project is doing that is new is truly generalizing and
integrating explicit and latent quality indicators which allow
users to ascertain the fitness of digital library resources. Most
search engine components have only one indicator: content-query
similarity (â€œrelevanceâ€). Google only has two, adding PageRank to the
latter. Our system, QM-search, will have an unlimited number of these,
which will be customizable by the digital librarian for the target
community and collections, and even customizeable from user to user or
search to search.

Some basic examples of quality indicators that digital libraries might
be able to exploit would be activations (views online or check-outs in
circulation), selection (compilation in â€œbookmarkâ€ lists online or
additions to course reserves lists), extent of review (from a peer-
reviewed journal, conference, or not?), or citation-based metrics.

The ouput of QM-search will be in a completely generalized XML format,
with the search results represented as a structure based on the
structure specified in the input â€œorganization specâ€. This XML output
can be transformed into presentation HTML resembling anything from a
â€œlinearâ€ Google-like search results list to an A9-like column display to
more exotic groupings and breakdowns.

Requirements for QM-search are being gleaned from focus groups being
conducted at Emory (preliminary results will be shared), and development
is being conducted as a high-level layer atop the excellent Lucene open
source search engine project.

The number of programmers in the library world is growing and our individual efforts have shown great promise, but they exist largely as a spectacle that few libraries can enjoy. We need better means to aggregate our efforts and share solutions that can be employed by libraries without programming staff.

Looking outside libraries, we see some interesting examples in the blog world. The blog world is growing with new bloggers every day, but the most interesting aspect is how many people with limited technical skills are using (maintaining and configuring) blog applications like WordPress or Moveable Type, and how quickly the contributions of the many plugin and theme developers are implemented on those blogs. What lessons can we learn from this and how might a library application built from those lessons work? Are some software architectures better at leveraging the network effects of the growing number of developers in our community than others?

Iâ€™m working on a project that attempts to answer those questions and I hope to release a public beta shortly (update: it's <a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/11133/">WPopac</a>, <a href="http://www.plymouth.edu/library/opac/search/joe+monninger">online now</a>). Iâ€™d like to demo it and ask for participation.

It can be difficult to enhance, fix or extend legacy/closed-source web applications such as online catalogs without being able to alter the web application directly.

I will discuss using AHAH (Asynchronous HTTPRequest and HTML) as a technique for doing so and compare it to AJAX, proxying and SSI. Examples from the Seattle Public Libraryâ€™s next generation online catalog will be presented. Performance and scalability concerns will also be covered, time permitting.

Libraries face tremendous challenges to create effective and responsive institutions in a Googlezon world. But the type of leadership we need so far hasnâ€™t materialized. If it isnâ€™t going to come from the administrators, let it come from the coders. In this talk I will build a case for establishing Code4Lib as a nonprofit library software cooperative. A financial structure would allow us to put real resourcesâ€”both financial and humanâ€”into bringing libraries into the 21st century.

With a bit of <a href="http://www.textualize.com/trac/browser/code4lib/calgen.py">python</a> the code4lib 2006 <a href="/conference/2006/schedule">schedule</a> has been encoded using the <a href="http://www.microformats.com/wiki/hcalendar">hCalendar</a> microformat. hCalendar allows you to bundle up event information so it is available downstream to machines that crawl the content, while keeping the content readable for us humans. It is really very easy to grok, and the only reason for the script was to avoid repetitive typing.

Here's what a sample event looks like in hCalendar:

<code type="html">

title: unAPI version 0
created: 1137187056

Attached is the first version of the unAPI spec.  Excerpting:

        <p>"unAPI is a simple website <span class="caps">API</span> convention.  There are many wonderful APIs and protocols for syndicating, searching, and harvesting content from diverse services on the web.  They're all <strong>great</strong>, and they're all already <strong>widely used</strong>, but they're all <strong>different</strong>.  We want <strong>one <span class="caps">API</span></strong> for the most basic operations necessary to perform simple clipboard-copy functions across all sites.  We also want this <span class="caps">API</span> to be able to be easily layered on top of other well-known APIs."</p>

And:

        <p>"The objective of unAPI is to enable web sites with <span class="caps">HTML</span> interfaces to information-rich objects to simultaneously publish richly structured metadata for those objects, or those objects themselves, in a predictable and consistent way for machine processing."</p>

This specification is being developed under the <a href="http://curtis.med.yale.edu/dchud/log/project/rogue/announcing-rogue-05">ROGUE 05</a> process.  The next revision, revision 1, is due on Thursday, 16 Feb 2006, and is dependent on at least three working implementations to move forward.  That date is also day 2 of <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2006">code4lib 2006</a>; I will be speaking about unAPI on day 1, and hopefully we'll have a breakout session following up the talk which will be a great time to discuss the spec, to try implementing it, and to work on revision 1 for release the next day. :)

We are tracking milestones, notes, and document revisions within a private basecamp project, but interested parties are welcome to participate (contact me for access).

The list of record for unAPI development is the <a href="http://cipolo.med.yale.edu/mailman/listinfo/gcs-pcs-list">gcs-pcs-list</a>.  Please send questions/comments/implementation feedback there.

[Update (2005-05-21)]: Please note that the official unAPI site now lives at <a href="http://unapi.info/">unapi.info</a>.

<p>Maybe you're nervous and you're afraid you'll mess up. It's a lot easier to plan and deliver a five minute talk than it is to deliver a long talk. And if you do mess up, at least the painful part will be over quickly.</p>

<p>Maybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a question, or invite people to help you with your project, or boast about something you did, or tell a short cautionary story. These things are all interesting and worth talking about, but there might not be enough to say about them to fill up thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Maybe you have a lot of things to say, and you're already going to give a long talk on one of them, and you don't want to hog the spotlight. There's nothing wrong with giving several Lightning Talks. Hey, they're only five minutes.</p>

Jeremy has set up a <a href="http://wiki.library.oregonstate.edu/confluence/display/code4lib/Home">wiki</a> where you can sign up for lightning talks and add/edit breakout session ideas. Yeah, there is a page here at code4lib.org too, but we've copied over the existing entries from there. The wiki should be more flexible for collaboration once the conference starts.

As it's not shorts and t-shirt weather, and there seems to be a reasonable number of folks staying at the holiday inn express, it'd be sensible, clever and perhaps even organised of us to arrange to travel together to the conference venue in the mornings.

Would it be possible to meet in the lobby at 8:20?  Or leave notes at the desk?

created: 1139874436
---
For those attending code4lib, Corvallis is going to be a bit cool to cold, depending from where you are from. The forecast calls for highs in the low 40's at tops, and lows in the lower 30's or even upper 20's. The good news is that at the moment, it is supposed to be fairly dry Wednesday through Friday, though expect rain on Tuesday. The bad news is that the rain/dry forcast can quickly change. We do have a shuttle from the hotel to the restaurants / bars for each evening's social time, just in case.

[<strong>Update</strong> (2006-03-16): the new home for unAPI and this spec is <a href="http://unapi.info/">unapi.info</a>.]

Attached is revision 1 of unAPI.  Revision 2 is due in one month.

unAPI has changed significantly since version 0.  A combination of many sharp minds from various nations and healthy skepticism and a variety of scrumptious Oregon microbrews on tap nearby has narrowed its scoped and tightened its approach significantly.

There are still a number of issues to consider but revision 1 is a solid spec that should be easily implemented in a variety of contexts.

My apologies for the release of the spec being seven minutes past deadline PST.

There was a session at code4lib 2006 on using IM bots to deliver library services.  I was at a different session, but I thought about it a bit and realized that the "jake-like" queries to the CUFTS database could fairly easily be adapted to the IM world.  "jake-like" queries being "where is this journal indexed?", "where is there fulltext for this journal and what's the coverage", etc.  I started on a quick bot while I was there, got that working and finished up a fairly comprehensive version last week.

Connecting the bot to the IM network was very easy thanks to Net::OSCAR.  Unfortunately, it doesn't include file transfers, but everything else I wanted was there.  Since I already had the database and queries mostly written, the bulk of the work was formatting the results for IM size display, handling "more" commands, and writing help.

So, you can now add "CUFTS2" as a contact on AOL/AIM/ICQ (they're all on the OSCAR network) and send it queries.  Here's an example transcript.

> help

This bot is used to search the CUFTS journals database for information on where journals are indexed, available in fulltext, and what the coverage periods are.
"help commands" will give a list of valid commands.

There is an incomplete list of regulars <a href="http://www.code4lib.org/node/87">here</a>. This is not an official list of any kind. If you're not on it yet, feel free to add your nick, your name, and a link to your website.

<h3>What about <strike>panizzi</strike> zoia?</h3>

Zoia is a <a href="http://supybot.com/">supybot</a> who hangs out in #code4lib. To get a list of commands it understands, type <code>@list</code> (the "@" symbol tells zoia you're talking to it). Here's a quick list of the more common commands:

<dl>
<dt><code>@help</code></dt>
  <dd>Find out how to use a particular command. The correct syntax is (usually) <code>@help</code> followed by the command name, e.g. <code>@help karma</code>. You can also just ask the other people on the channel how to do something.</dd>
<dt><code>@quote</code></dt>
  <dd>Add or display quotes that have been added to zoia's quote database. Type <code>@quote add "<jeffdavis> welcome to code4lib!"</code> to add a quote, <code>@quote jeffdavis</code> to see the last quote from a specific person, or <code>@quote random</code> to see a random quote</dd>
<dt><code>@naf</code></dt>
  <dd>Look up a term in the Library of Congress authority files.</dd>
<dt><code>@ana</code></dt>
  <dd>Create an English-language anagram of the word or phrase that you enter.</dd>
<dt><code>@tunes, @alltunes, @blockparty</code></dt>
  <dd>These commands look up people's listening history on <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>. <code>@tunes jeffdavis</code> displays the last song that jeffdavis listened to, <code>@alltunes jeffdavis</code> lists the last half-dozen or so songs jeffdavis listened to, and <code>@blockparty</code> lists what people in the <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/code4lib/">code4lib group on Last.fm</a> are listening to. (Go ahead and add yourself to the code4lib Last.fm group if you like. You need to type <code>@audioscrobbler add yourusername</code> to be added to the blockparty.)</dd>
<dt><code>@insult, @praise</code></dt>
  <dd>Causes zoia to insult or praise the person or thing of your choice.</dd>
<dt><code>@karma</code></dt>
  <dd>You can increase or decrease the karma for a person or thing by appending two pluses or two minuses to the person or thing's name.  For example, if you type <code>jeffdavis++</code>, my karma score will increase by 1. (You can't raise your own karma.) Type <code>@karma jeffdavis</code> to see the karma for that person/thing, or just <code>@karma</code> for the three highest and lowest karma scores.  You can only raise or lower karma by one point at a time (so <code>jeffdavis++++</code> will only raise jeffdavis' karma by one point, not two), and commenting does work (<code>jeffdavis-- # you suck!</code> works correctly, thanks to gsf's regex-fu).</dd>
<dt><code>@google</code></dt>
  <dd>Do a Google search and show the first few results in-channel.</dd>
<dt><code>@more</code></dt>
  <dd>If the results of a command are over a certain length, zoia may end his response with "more" or "2 more messages". You can use the <code>@more</code> command to display the rest of zoia's response. If you didn't give zoia the original command, add the nick of the person who did, e.g. <code>@more jeffdavis</code> (this only works for one message deep on another nick).</dd>
<dt><code>@dunno</code></dt>
  <dd>When you send zoia a message it doesn't understand (for example, if you address it as if it were a person or get the syntax of a command wrong), it responds with a random error message. You can use the <code>@dunno</code> command to add a new error message to its repertoire, e.g. <code>@dunno I don't know what you're talking about.</code></dd>
</dl>

<h3>What do people talk about in-channel?</h3>

Information technology, software development, librarianship, cultural heritage, digital repositories, the web, programming languages, cataloging, metadata standards, games, food... just about anything! The channel is informal, and a lot of off-topic socializing takes place. If you don't understand something, just ask. That goes for the techie stuff as well as the social stuff -- for many regulars, #code4lib is where they learn about all kinds of interesting technology.

<h3>What are the ground rules?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/code4lib/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md">Code4lib code of conduct</a>.
  <li>Respect everyone.</li>
  <li>Be sensitive of the fact that cultures, opinions and ideas of what is 
 funny or appropriate are different, and that text is a very poor medium 
for conveying humor.</li>
<li>Because this is the case, and people will be people, be quick to forgive and slow to take offense.</li>
</li>
</ol>

Aside from that, it's a bit of a free-for-all. Basically, use common sense, be respectful of others, and don't do anything that will get everyone kicked off of Freenode.

<h3>what does "++" mean?</h3>

The double-plus is used to increment someone's karma (see above, in the section about zoia).

<h3>How do you do that thing where you talk about yourself in third person?</h3>

Type <code>/me agrees</code>. This allows you to send a message like <code>***jeffdavis agrees</code> rather than literally saying "I agree".

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>Library technologists (developers, programmers, sysadmins, and systems librarians) need better ways to share information both among themselves and with the library community as a whole, including public and technical services staff, library management, and other non-IT specialists. The code4lib journal facilitates technical communication by publishing articles on tools, specs, and challenges in the world of library technology. The journal focuses on showcasing practical hacks, working code, best practices, and implementation issues, and also includes higher-level discussions of large projects or challenges pertaining to information technology in libraries. It is what Roy Tennant calls a "truly technical rag" for libraries.</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The code4lib journal publishes two types of articles:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Features: Longer, more formal articles on topics such as large projects, trends, or theoretical issues.</li>
	<li>Hacks: Shorter articles on successful or failed projects, calls to action, common mistakes, useful techniques, and actual code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Issues are formally released every two months, but individual articles may be available prior to the official publication date.</p>

<h3>Editorial Policies</h3>

<h4>Submission</h4>

<p>Anyone may submit material to be considered for publication in the code4lib journal. The editorial board also reserves the right to solicit submissions from conference presenters, bloggers, and anyone else who has something interesting and useful to say. The submission process is the same for both types of articles; the review board decides which type of article a given submission is.</p>

<h4>Editorial Review</h4>

<p>All articles considered for publication are subject to the following editorial process:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The submissions editor receives submissions, solicited and otherwise, and conducts a preliminary review based on the following criteria:
	  <ul>
            <li>usefulness;</li>
            <li>newness;</li>
            <li>relevance.</li>
	  </ul>
        </li>
	<li>Articles that satisfy the above criteria are made available for review and comment by the review board and the broader community.</li>
        <li>Based on comments made during the review process, the review board votes on whether to publish an article. Possible votes are:
          <ul>
            <li>Approved without further revision.</li>
            <li>Approved, but some revisions required.</li>
            <li>Rejected.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The review board also votes on what type of article it will be published as -- a "feature" or a "hack".</li>
	<li>Articles requiring revision are revised by the author based on comments from the review board and the broader community, then resubmitted for another vote. This may occur more than once depending on how the review board votes.</li>
	<li>Articles not requiring further revision are published in a subsequent issue of the journal.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Publication</h4>

<p>New issues are released every two months.</p>

<p>Articles which have been finalized for publication may be made available as "pre-release" articles prior to their official publication date.</p>

<h4>Rights</h4>

<p>Authors hold the copyright in their works. Articles are released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/" title="Visit page outside Confluence" rel="nofollow">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs2.5 License</a>, which permits reproduction of unaltered copies of articles for non-commercial purposes. Since the author retains copyright, parties interested in other arrangements (such as commercial republication or publication of derivative works) should contact the author to make arrangements.</p>

title: "#code4lib logging"
created: 1142868643

Since the code4lib <a href="http://www.code4lib.org/2006">conference</a> the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/code4lib">#code4lib</a> irc channel has gained a lot of new voices with new ideas. In fact <a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/archives/2006/03/12/fifty-ways-to-lose-your-techies/">dsalo</a> and ksclarke have already said all I can think of saying on the topic of the changing culture of the #code4lib channel. Some people have suggested that some of the ideas, such as a journal, doing outreach/consulting work, etc will require the irc channel to become a bit more 'professional'. 

My theory is that having a public log might help encourage this sort of atmosphere. The logging would allow you to go 'off the record' if you really want to say something and don't want it viewable in the logs. In addition to making you think before you type, logging would have some other benefits:


<ol>
<li>it would allow people with lives to scan the logs looking for stuff and get other work done</li>
<li>it would encourage international participation by people who aren't online with the (Eastern|Central|Mountain|Pacific) Standard Tribe</li>
<li>and most importantly it would allow for <a href="http://backchannel.stamen.com/">interesting</a> <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/node/27">consuming</a> applications</li>
</ol>

At any rate I think that code4lib changing is a good thing. Afterall, an organism that has ceased changing is umm, dead. Unless there are any objections I'm going to create a poll and see what the general feeling on this is.

<p>Maybe you're nervous and you're afraid you'll mess up. It's a lot easier to plan and deliver a five minute talk than it is to deliver a long talk. And if you do mess up, at least the painful part will be over quickly.</p>

<p>Maybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a question, or invite people to help you with your project, or boast about something you did, or tell a short cautionary story. These things are all interesting and worth talking about, but there might not be enough to say about them to fill up thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Maybe you have a lot of things to say, and you're already going to give a long talk on one of them, and you don't want to hog the spotlight. There's nothing wrong with giving several Lightning Talks. Hey, they're only five minutes.</p>

<li><em>Prepared talks</em> - 20 minutes, which must center on "tools" (some kick-ass new software library or integration platform), "specs" (how to get the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones), or "challenges" (Some Big Problem  we should collectively address). We will evaluate proposals on criteria of geekiness, usefulness, newness, and diversity of topics.</li>

<li><em><a href="/conference/2007/lightningtalks">Lightning talks</a></em>  - 5 minutes, those interested sign up on a wiki that opens at the start of the conference.  *Hard* 5 minute limit... at 4 minutes the next person gets up and starts attaching their screen, and somebody keeps a hard count.</li>

<li><em><a href="http://code4lib.org/wiki/2007">Breakouts</a></em> - People interested in the same project/problem can hang out in a space together for 60-90 minute blocks. Somebody near to the project/problem can coordinate discussion, set up hackers, tackle a challenge session topic, etc. Larger groups will get separate space, smaller groups can just spread out in the larger conference room space.</li>

<!--li>A North American location (for the "main" conference in February, overseas locations will be considered for additional events).</li-->
<li>A host (usually a committee) willing to make local arrangements and coordinate with the site. Many colleges and universities have conference planning assistance.</li>
<li>An auditorium or similar space suitable for the conference itself (capacities in recent years have been 400-450), and room for 8-12 pre-conference workshops "breakout" groups (30-50), which may be a combination of the main space and smaller rooms. Note that while a keynote may be held in an auditorium, it is preferable for the main conference day to have tables and chairs for seating. </li>
<li>Wireless network available to attendees free or sponsored by the conference</li>
<li>A commitment to work with the conference planning group to help keep attendee costs to a minimum. Past costs have been about $120-200 including meals for 3 days. This requires substantial sponsorship from outside institutions and the hosting institution.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Additional Desirable Qualities</strong>

<ul>
<li>Small college or university town (why? "amenities", my friend, amenities). Conferences are also often held in large cities.</li>
<li>Reasonably near a major airport (we are prepared to interpret this liberally if the other qualifications are strong)</li>
<li>Some distance away from the last conference site, all things being equal (to spread the travel pain)</li>
<li>Pre-conference day/events, preferably with optional separate registration</li>
</ul>

<strong>What the Hosting Site is Responsible For</strong>

<ul>
<li>Since there is no legal Code4Lib entity, the hosting site must provide a fiscal sponsor for signing any necessary contracts for space or hotel rental. From a legal point of view, the sponsor is putting on the conference with Code4Lib branding. This institution is responsible for gathering sponsorship and registration funds and then transferring them to next year's host. The hosting site may choose to contract with other entities as necessary to fulfill these responsibilities.</li>
<li>Managing the program planning process (scheduling and arranging the presentation application and voting process, etc.)  Prior years have used a voting mechanism tied to the Code4Lib website (e.g., <a href="http://vote.code4lib.org/election/">this</a>); the same system may be used for subsequent conferences.</li>
<li>Arranging evening networking opportunities (e.g., interesting and/or good restaurants and bars and/or events)</li>
<li>Leading the effort to sign on conference sponsors (various members of the community are expected to volunteer to help sign up sponsors</li>
</ul>

<strong>What the Conference Planning Groups are Responsible For</strong>

<p>These items are the responsibility of the Code4Lib Conference planning group (anyone on the conference planning list, which is open to anyone), but the conference host is often actively involved with these aspects as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>Participating in garnering conference sponsors</li>
<li>Assisting with conference planning tasks</li>
</ul>

title: Improving Code4LibCon 200*
created: 1151796157

There have been <a href="http://www.librarywebchic.net/wordpress/2006/07/01/on-being-the-library-web-chic/">some posts</a> in the blogosphere about things participants did not enjoy about the previous year's Code4Lib conference.  Since planning has started for the 2007 conference, I thought now would be a good time to open the doors and ask what should be improved about the conference.  What should be done the same and what should be done differently?  Here is a place to start gathering voices...

<dt>Arlington, Texas</dt>
<dd>Proposed by Michael Doran</dd>
<dd>UT Arlington has a lot going for it as a conference venue. Prime location: For those not familiar with Arlington, Texas, we are located smack dab in middle of the Dallas/Fort Worth “Metroplex”...In the interest of full disclosure, let me say that the good transportation news is that it is easy to get to Arlington, but the bad news is that it is hard to get around Arlington if you don’t have a car. Although Arlington has a population of about 300,000, there is no public transportation here. (There is public transportation in Dallas and Fort Worth and train service between the two.) Related to the local Arlington lack-of-public-transportation problem is the fact that there are no accommodations directly on campus, and probably no acceptable accommodations within walking distance, so some type of shuttle service would have to be arranged.</dd>

<div style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img src="/misc/books.jpg" align="left" /></div>

So a bunch of us in #code4lib are thinking of starting up a book club to read tech books together, learn from each other in the process, and hopefully use a bit of peer pressure to propel ourselves into actually finishing a book. 

The first book we're proposing we read is <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a> which is available in print and also online. Lisp and functional languages in general are enjoying a bit of a renaissance at the moment, so we figured this might be a good one to start with. It's also very, umm, practical--building working code to parse ID3 tags (metadata!) and the like.

Should we create a google group or something? Any suggested name for the group? Is there really any need to limit our membership to people in libraries? How about books4code?


Interested? Suggestions? Bueller? Feel free to tack comments on here.

<em>Update:</em> A <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/books4code">Google Group</a> and a <a href="http://books.code4lib.org">wiki</a> have been created</a>.

I created the Atom by hand and carried over the majority of the metadata. It's valid so you should be able to parse it for whatever you want.

We are now accepting proposals for prepared talks for <a href="http://www.code4lib.org/conference/2007">Code4lib 2007</a>.

Code4lib 2007 is a loosely structured conference for library
technologists to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be
inspired, and forge collaborations. It is also an outgrowth of the
Access HackFest, wrapped into a conference-ish format. It is *the* event
for technologists building digital libraries and digital information
systems, tools, and software. Code4lib 2007 will be held from February
28 through March 2 in Athens, Georgia.



<strong>Prepared Talk Information</strong>

Prepared talks are 20 minutes, and must center on "tools" (some cool new
software, software library or integration platform), "specs" (how to get
the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones), or
"challenges" (One or more big problems we should collectively address).
We will evaluate proposals on criteria of usefulness, newness,
geekiness, and diversity of topics.

Prepared talk proposals of 75 words or less are being accepted for
review now. <strong>Please send your name, email address, and proposal to:
<a href="mailto:code4libcon@georgialibraries.org">code4libcon@georgialibraries.org</a></strong>.

We cannot accept every prepared talk proposal, but multiple lightning
talk sessions will provide everyone who wishes to present with ample
opportunity to show off. Lightning talks are 5-minute presentations that
any conference attendee can sign up to present.

The proposal deadline is November 30, 2006, and proposers will be
notified by December 15, 2006. Voting on the proposals will be public,
and held in a <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/panel_picker/">similar fashion to SXSW</a>.

The server on which code4lib.org lives will be moving this week.  I haven't set up an exact time yet, but there will be some downtime as it is moved to a new host.  It may be Monday afternoon or perhaps Wed. or Thurs. (I'm hoping for Mon. afternoon).  Details, when known, will be posted here and on the mailing list and IRC channel.

<em>Update:</em> Looks like Wed. will be the day for server migration.

The <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/">Simile</a> folks made MARC, MODS and RDF versions of <a href="http://library.mit.edu/">Barton</a> (the MIT Library Catalog) available as a <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/rdf-test-data/README.txt">test data set</a>.

To show code4lib's support for Simile and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data">open-library-data</a> we've set up some torrents for the data. 

<ul>

<li><a href="http://code4lib.org/torrents/barton.rdf.torrent">http://code4lib.org/torrents/barton.rdf.torrent</a></li>

In light of the change in the <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/rdf-test-data/barton/README.txt">README </a> file at MIT:

<blockquote>
What happened to the data?
--------------------------
   
   We are currently evaluating legal issues about ownership and licensing possibilities
   and hope to be able to be back online with it soon. Wish us luck.
 
</blockquote>

the torrent has been temporarily (hopefully) disabled. Thanks to MIT for continuing to investigate how to make large bibliographic data sets available to the general public.

<b>Richard Wallis</b>

From Z39.50 to xISBN, they share the limitation of providing a single stream of data from a single source.

How to add value to data from one source with relevant data from another, and how do you orchestrate that interaction in a scalable way?

A review and practical demonstration of augmentation APIs and their orchestration in a way that would make those used to Unix Pipes principles, feel at home.

<b>Andrew Nagy</b>

Villanova University’s Falvey Memorial Library has longed for a beautiful pig; however, we determined in early 2006 that pigs were only good at searching for truffles, so we decided to build our own OPAC.

After developing our own custom Digital Library from a Native XML Database, we quickly appreciated the ease of development with XQuery and XSLT. We then launched full speed ahead into the development of a new OPAC from scratch using XML technologies and MARCXML.

This presentation will describe the process of choosing an NXDB and optimizing it for large data set performance. Developing searches that take about 2 minutes to process and optimizing them down to about 2 seconds.

<b>Ross Singer</b>

In August, Georgia Tech launched 'the Ümlaut', an OpenURL middleware layer intended to bridge the gap between vendor supplied databases, our SFX link resolver, our catalog and freely available gray literature. There were many breakdowns with our link resolver, most notably with conference proceedings, that merely left users frustrated. Librarians pointed at the vendors' crappy data, vendors blamed the librarians, but this did nothing to help the users.

By indexing the opac data a little differently, utilizing the search engine APIs, OAI-PMH providers and various other web services, we were able to enhance the functionality of our link resolver to eliminate majority of our most problematic use cases. When new issues arise, it is trivial to add new logic to handle them.

This presentation will use the Ümlaut as an example of bringing together simple, easily accessible tools into one framework and will open dialog on how these methods can open other bottlenecks in our traditional workflows.

<p>
9am - 5pm, Tuesday February 27

<strong>Location Updated</strong>: Because of the overwhelming response, the pre-conference has been moved to the <a href="http://www.uga.edu/campuslife/facilities/tate.html">Tate Student Center</a>, Room 137.

</p>

<p>
This will be a full day event devoted to <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/">lucene</a> and <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/solr/">solr</a>.
The event will be led by Erik Hatcher, committer on the Lucene and Solr projects, and co-author of <a href="http://lucenebook.com/">Lucene in Action</a>, and <a href="http://www.manning.com/hatcher/">Java Development with Ant</a>.
</p>
<p>
The morning will be devoted to background and theory, and the afternoon will be an opportunity to try some hands-on projects. Participants should either bring a wi-fi enabled laptop or be prepared to look over someone else's shoulder. So that we can get as much accomplished in the workshop as possible, we will provide a list of software and documentation to be downloaded before the workshop. If you are interested in working with a specific data set, please bring the data set with you, preferably on a sharable media format (e.g., CDROM, USB Flash Drive) so that we can exchange data sets quickly and easily. To save time at the event, please get your data into XML before the conference. 
</p>
<p>
There is no registration fee to attend the workshop. <strike>However, so that we can plan for adequate space, please register by emailing bess [at] virginia [dot] edu with a simple message that you plan to attend.</strike> <font color="red">Registration is full!</font> Then remember to book your flight a day early and reserve an extra night in the hotel. <font color="red">Also, please join the mailing list for the pre-conference if you want to receive all the communication that will be sent out about it: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/code4libpreconf">http://groups.google.com/group/code4libpreconf</a></font>
</p>
<p>
<font color="red">ADDED:</font>
We have over sixty people, and more people are joining all the time. That is a lot of people to handle for a hands on workshop. In order to handle this, we're going to divide into teams based on what language you feel most comfortable using with solr. I'd also like to ask that a couple of people volunteer to be the coordinator of each team. If you're a coordinator, your job is to make sure you have downloaded all the software, you have a good data set to work with, and you've at least run through the tutorial and been able to get some data into solr. Also, you should probably be pretty comfortable with your chosen programming language. You can come here to sign up for a team, and indicate whether you'd be willing to act as a coordinator. The purpose of this is to make sure we know before the event whether we have enough coordinators for each language, and to make sure we don't spend all our time the day of the event trying to form groups.

<p>Taking a <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/story/dear-code4lib-you-look-good-in-xhtml">cue </a> from <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/">dchud</a> the #code4lib irc channel is now being <a href="/irc-logs">logged</a>. To view the logs you *must* be logged in to code4lib.org. You can prefix any message you want with: ! and your message *will not* be logged. Try it out. I think this is a reasonable compromise that works well in <a href="http://swhack.com/">other</a> online communities with an irc component.</p>

<p>The logging is done by bartleby who is a <a href="http://rbach.priv.at/Patches/LogBot-20051116.diff">patched</a> and modified (the ! functionality) version of <a href="http://www.jibble.org/logbot/">LogBot</a>. This is a work in progress as always, and a community effort so please share your ideas thoughts about this....and take a look at the shiny XHTML source for your favorite xml parser to chew on.</p>

(my first code4lib post)

<a href="http://inkdroid.org">Ed Summers</a> and <a href="http://rubybrain.org/">William Groppe</a> have jumped in head-strong to crafting a Ruby DSL to Solr.  <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/solrb">solrb</a> is coming along nicely thanks to our collaborations.

Another early adopter asked a question on the solr-user e-mail list, and I replied with a lot of  <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Faceted-search-problem-tf3025078.html">juicy tidbits</a> to whet your appetite.

We're moving as fast as we can in order to use this infrastructure for the basis of <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Flare">Solr Flare</a>, destined to be faceted browsing plugins for Rails allowing your Rails application to easily benefit from what Solr and solrb offer.  Solr Flare will debut at the code4lib <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2007/lucenesolr/">pre-conference event</a> in whatever form it happens to be in by then.

If you're a Rubyist who loves the goodness of Lucene and/or Ferret, you'll love Solr.  We aim for solrb and Flare to be the Ruby way to Solr's heart.

And especially tasty for the code4lib crowd is the Solr importer that is <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/solr/trunk/client/ruby/solrb/examples/marc/marc_importer.rb">under way</a>.

Hungry yet?  I've got a stone, anyone got any carrots?

In looking for a solution to organize  a local elementary school library, <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> was my first stop.  And perhaps my last... except for faceting it with <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Flare">Flare</a>, of course.

I scanned a few books into Delicious Library: 
<img width=550 src="http://www.code4lib.org/files/delicious_library.png"/>

And then I exported the library (to a tab-delimited format), wrote a little <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/solr/trunk/client/ruby/solrb/examples/delicious_library/dl_importer.rb">Delicious Library export -> Solr importer script</a>, and my Delicious Library is now faceted with Flare:
<img width=550 src="http://www.code4lib.org/files/flare.jpg"/>
What you see in the Flare screenshot is a filter already applied for the Grammar genre, and the Ajax term look-up drop down of me pausing after having typed "lang".

Thanks go to David Walker for letting me borrow some CSS to kick start an improved look for Flare, though the ugly bits of the look are my own doing.  The UI will only improve from here.

But wait, that's not all.  Like everyone else, I'm fascinated by the work going on at <a href="http://simile.mit.edu">SIMILE</a> (*waves to <a href="http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/">Stefano</a> & David).  One of their many cool tools is <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/exhibit/">Exhibit</a> (not to be confused with the vastly different upcoming Collex Exhibit builder).  It could not have been easier to tie Simile's Exhibit into Flare:

<img width=550 src="http://www.code4lib.org/files/flare_simile.jpg"/>

All it took to tie the two together was to follow the <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Exhibit/Getting_Started_Tutorial">Exhibit Getting Started tutorial</a>, which simply involved copying and pasting the HTML template, adding in the facet names to be shown, and pointing the JSON link to a tiny Rails controller I added to Flare:
<code>
class SimileController < ApplicationController
  def exhibit
    req = .... # Details of constructing the Solr request omitted, refactoring is guaranteed.
    @data = SOLR.send(req)
    
    # Exhibit seems to require a label attribute to be happy
    @data.each {|d| d['label'] = d['title_text']}
    
    respond_to do |format| 
      format.html # renders exhibit.rhtml 
      format.json { render :json => {'items' => @data}.to_json } # Exhibit seems to require data to be in a 'items' Hash
    end                                         
  end
end
</code>

The Exhibit facets entirely client-side, and as such it only gets the data given the already selected constraints of the main Flare browse interface (and also limited to the first 10 rows from Solr implicitly).  

Now we're cooking!

[Delicious Library developers note: please add smart shelves, just like every other Mac OS X app currently has.  I want all my signed books, for example, on a virtual shelf.]

This presentation will cover the copyright issues and pitfalls that arise when a locally created software application is being considered for release under an open-source license.  It will be based on the knowledge and experience gained shepherding two applications through the intellectual property disclosure process at the University of Texas at Arlington, so that the applications could be officially released as open source.

As anyone who has encoded video knows, it can be a slow process. If you happen to be in IRC be sure to thank ecorrado and npeden for their work on the videos. The videos are slowly being uploaded to code4lib. As space needs to be shuffled a little bit on Anvil I've taken the liberty of mirroring the videos at Michigan State and also uploading them to Google to make them easier to embed.

The files that have been processed <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=label%3A%22code4lib2007%22">are tagged with code4lib2007 on Google</a>. I've also included a link to download the MPEG-4 file and embedded the video for watching <a href="http://code4lib.org/2007/schedule">on the presentation pages</a>. You'll need a player that can handle MPEG-4 (H.264) and AAC audio to view the downloaded files. The latest Quicktime should work, as well as VLC and MPlayer. If you compiled either yourself, be sure to include mp4 and aac support.

It may be awhile before all the videos are up. Once they are I'll probably work on getting pod/vodcasts up.

<strong>Update</strong>: I'm also dumping the audio from the videos to mp3 for those who would prefer just the audio for portability. A podcast will be forthcoming. The mp3's are linked from the presentation pages.

<h3><a name="My_Adventures_in_Getting_Data_into_the_ArchivistsToolkit"></a>My Adventures in Getting Data into the ArchivistsToolkit</h3>

<p>Georgia Tech Archives is moving its accessions database from a home grown sql/php based archival database tool to the <a href="http://archiviststoolkit.org/">Archivist's Toolkit</a> which was recently released. The easiest route I thought was to export the current data to two spreadsheets in csv format, clean it up, and import the results. It couldn't be that hard: just convert csv to Toolkit format. </p> 

<h4><a name="Get_The_Data_From_The_Old_Tool"></a>Get The Data From The Old Tool</h4>

<p>That was as easy as pushing the right buttons on phpmyadmn. We ended up with two tables; one described the donors, the other the accessions linked to donors by via donor ids.</p> 
<h4><a name="Data_Cleanup"></a>Data Cleanup </h4>

<p> From the outset we planned to clean up data.  Initially we thought we had to purge double donor records but it turned that step wasn't actually necessary, so I skip the details here.  The cleanup incolved making accession numbers more regular, correcting typos that came to our attention when we saw all accessions/names in one big table, ... </p>

<h4><a name="Get_The_Archivists_Toolkit_up_and_running"></a>Get The Archivists Toolkit up and running</h4>

<p> Downloading and installing the Toolkit client on the Windows machines was a breeze. The same was unfortunately not true for my Ubuntu machine. First the installer refused to even do its magic dying with mysteries messages about not finding system libraries. The installer including the jre had the same problem. Luckily Jason Fowler posted his solution on the Toolkit's mailing list, see his <a href="http://neoarch.wordpress.com/2007/01/28/hint-on-configuring-the-archivists-toolkit-on-linux/">blog entry</a>.</p>

<p> The only thing I can add here: &ldquo;vi -b&rdquo; provides nice binary edit as well, or do <br/> <tt> cat [FileName] | sed "s/export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL/#xport LD_ASSUME_KERNEL/ </tt> </p>

<h4>The Simple Plan </h4>

<ol style="margin-left: .75cm; list-style-type: decimal;">

  <li >
    
    <p> Redefine column names in the csv files to match the names used in the Toolkit. </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
    
    <p>Write a Perl script to generate a Toolkit import file using the data from the csv files.  </p> 
 </li>


  <li>
    
    <p>Let the Toolkit read it. </p>

  </li>

</ol>

<p> It did not turn out to be that easy.</p>

<p> The Toolkit offers to import accessions and names data from a flat csv style file. It insists on tab delimination, which I found rather unreadable when I needed to check whether my script did generate the correct information.  </p> 

<p> In addition and more importantly, since this is a flat csv file in which each property can only head up one column it is not possible to link an accession to more than one donor/name.  Accessions and names in the Toolkit data model have a many-to-many relationship, a name can be linked to several donors and an accession can have multiple names linked to it.  Thus the import format is far less expressive than the actual data model supported. It also doesn't match well with the data institutions will want to import.  </p>

<p> In our not untypical case we have many donors that represent a person and a corporation, which need to be represented as two distinct name records in the Toolkit. Both records need to be linked to the accession that they donated. Given the Toolkit's import format this is not possible.  We had to devise a work around.  </p> 


<h4>The Plan that worked </h4>
<p> Here follows,  without mentioning the false starts, how we did get our accessions data into the Toolkit: </p> 
<ol style="margin-left: 0.75cm; list-style-type: decimal;">

  <li >
    
    <p> I wrote a script that read an accessions csv file and generated a Toolkit import file selecting only those values from the csv file that are of interest to the Toolkit. This was straight forward.  We could have imported a csv file straight into the SQL database, but I was vary of importing 'bad' data, like dates in the future, accession numbers that don't live up to Toolkit standards, ... I wanted to leave the consistency checking to the Toolkit. </p>

  </li>

  <li >
    
    <p> Our archivist manually cleaned the donor information up. We ended up with a table that contained a name record for each person and each corporate donor. Where we previously had one record with a dual purpose we now had a name record for the corporation as well as the person. The archivist had to decide whether phone number, contact address information, and so forth applied to the person, the corporation, or both. There was no way around employing some human intelligence.</p> 
  </li>

  <li >
    
    <p> I added an option to my script to convert the donor name data into a Toolkit import file.  The donors could not be imported by themselves, so I generated fake accessions with numbers '9999.000.1', '9999.000.2', ... . One accession for each name. After importing this file and deleting the 'fake' accessions  all information about accessions and donors was in the Toolkit's database except for the way they are linked to each other.  </p>

  </li>

  <li >
    
    <p> With some more spreadsheet magic our archivist generated a Links table, which contained accession ids and name information. He basically had to replace donor ids in the accessions table with the full donor/name information. </p>

  </li>

  <li >
    
    <p> I added another option to the script that read the Links table from its csv file. For each link it </p> 
  </li>

<ul >

  <li >
    
    <p> checked whether the name information in the csv links table corresponded to a name in the csv names table (just to make sure the input data in the csv files was actually consistent)</p>

  </li>

  <li >
    
    <p> looked for an accession with the given id in the Toolkit database</p> 
  </li>

  <li >
    
    <p> searched for the name from the Links table in the Toolkit database </p> 
  </li>

  <li >
    
    <p> if everything went well it generated an SQL statement that would link the Toolkit's accession with the given name </p> 
  </li>
  </ul>

  <li >
    
    <p> Last we imported the generated sql file into the Toolkits database. </p> 
  </li>

</ol>


<h4 >The False Start</h4>

<p>In a first round I generated the donor and corporate name records by simply using name information like contact address, fax, email for both name records. I got to the point where the Toolkit informed me that all name records were imported successfully. In the next step of importing links my script complained about not finding many of the name records that were imported before.  It turned out that the Toolkit had quietly assumed that corporate record: </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.75cm;"> Georgia Tech , 404-898-0819</p>

<p>and&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.75cm;"> Georgia Tech , 786-234-1937</p>


<p>were the same. This is not an unreasonable assumption, but I would have liked to see a warning about the fact that the second record was not imported as a new corporate name. I was certainly glad my script had done some consistency checking.  </p> 

<h4>Looking back</h4>
<p> Obviously we had to decide how to match up properties from our legacy database with the ones in the Toolkit, which turned out to be easy because the Toolkit offers a complete list of choices.  </p> 
<p> 
Our legacy database's definition of a donor does not match perfectly with the Toolkit's definition of a name. So there was some unavoidable work and data massaging necessary here. 
</p> 
<p> The biggest complication we encountered was the fact that accessions are imported through only one table. Therefore accessions and donors can be imported only in pairs.  The Toolkit is smart enough to generate only one name where relevant name properties match across several accession import lines.  Thus it supports a many accessions to one donor type relationship but does not help in our case where we needed to import accessions that were linked to multiple donors. Having to work around this resctriction was the biggest obstacle to importing our data.  </p> 
<p> Now that I have this script in place we will also be able to add creator links to aceessions once we have that data cleaned up and arrannged in a suitable way.  </p>

 
<h4>One last remark &nbsp;</h4>

<p>The Toolkit provides an 'initialize-toolkit-database' script. I got tired of calling that program up (yes there are some pretty pictures), so I exported the data base right after setting it up. When I needed a fresh empty database I simply imported that file back in. </p>

Most have been done for some time but if you haven't noticed all presentations and lightning talks should have video up. Presentations also have audio and a podcast. Lightning talks will probably have audio in the nearish future. You can access the media from the pages below:

<b>Update: Looks like I forgot to change quite a few of the audio to CBR instead of VBR for the podcast. As such the Flash player on Odeo will make people sound like chipmunks. It should work fine in iTunes or your player of choice (as long as it's not flash). I'll try to redo the audio as soon as I can.</b>

<h3>What to submit:</h3>
<ul>
<li> A short but thorough description of the service you would like to
create using the CrossRef metadata, including estimated implementation time

<li> Links to software/services/protocols/standards that you may have
implemented in the past

<li> Your CV

<h3>Background on Crossref Metadata and Web Services:</h3>

CrossRef is an independent membership association, founded and directed by publishers. CrossRef helps connect users to primary research content by enabling publishers to work collectively. Our citation-linking network today covers over 27 million articles and other content items from several hundred scholarly and professional publishers.

CrossRef Web Services, or CWS, offers an easy-to-use suite of tools for authorized partners to collect metadata on a cross-publisher basis to streamline their own crawling, indexing, and linking services. One way to access the 27 million+ metadata records now registered in CrossRef is via our OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) interface. The CrossRef OAI-PMH repository interface serves as the central point for the distribution of metadata from participating publishers, utilizing a robust and widely adopted technology targeted at consumers of large quantities of metadata. Access to the CrossRef’s metadata repository is controlled by IP authentication and can be tailored to provide specific content from select publishers to each authorized recipient.

The metadata in CrossRef’s database consists of basic bibliographic information for each item, including author(s), title, journal name, ISSN, volume, issue, page, and DOI-URL pair. Here are links to some sample CWS metadata: <a href="http://www.crossref.org/oai-handler_sample.xml">http://www.crossref.org/oai-handler_sample.xml</a>, <a href="http://www.crossref.org/oai-pmh_sample2.xml">http://www.crossref.org/oai-pmh_sample2.xml</a>.

CrossRef's data repository is extensive but highly variable in quality from publisher to publisher. They have recently begun to take measures to ensure higher quality metadata. Any suggestions you may have regarding how best to achieve a higher level of data quality and consistency, as part of your proposal or otherwise, would be greatly appreciated.  Different but similarly basic metadata is collected for other types of content. In addition, many publishers now also deposit references as part of their metadata.

<b>February 25 - 28, 2008, Portland, Oregon, USA</b>

The third annual code4lib conference will be held in Portland, Oregon at the Embassy Suites located in downtown Portland. Anyone who is interested in helping to plan and organize the conference, and/or stay informed about conference activities and events, should join the conference planning discussion list, which can be found at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/code4libcon">http://groups.google.com/group/code4libcon</a>.

<h3>Overview Schedule</h3>

Preconferences (free): <em>Monday, February 25, 9 am - 5 pm</em>
Conference: <em>Tuesday, February 26, 8am</em> - <em>Thursday, February 28, Noon</em>

See also the <a href="/conference/2008/schedule"><b>Detailed Schedule</b>.</a> Feel free to add informal events on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/code4libcon/web/birds-of-a-feather">Birds of a Feather page.</a>
<!--break-->

<h3>Location</h3>

The conference will be held at the <a href="http://embassysuites1.hilton.com/en_US/es/hotel/PDXPSES-Embassy-Suites-Portland-Downtown-Oregon/index.do">Embassy Suites Downtown Portland</a>. A single suite is $150 per night, which includes full breakfast and free happy-hour. To make reservations, please call the hotel directly at (503)279-9000 and let the guest representative know that you are with the 2008 Code4Lib Conference.

Other places to stay: <a href="http://www.markspencer.com/">Mark Spencer Hotel</a> ($89-$169). For cheaper accommodations, some attendees will stay at the <a href="http://www.nwportlandhostel.com/">HI-Portland Hostel, Northwest</a>, $20-$25 per night (dorms), $40-$75 (private rooms), located 1.25 miles away.

<h3>Travel Information</h3>

<b><a href="http://www.flypdx.com/">Portland International Airport (PDX)</a></b>
Public Transit from PDX to the conference hotel:
<ol>
    <li> Board MAX Red Line to City Center & Beaverton TC
    <li> Get off at Oak/ SW 1st Ave MAX Station
    <li>Walk 0.2 mile northwest to Embassy Suites Hotel (319 SW Pine St) -
</ol>
Travel time: 39 minutes (including 5 minutes walking). At $20, the <a href="http://www.trimet.org/7daypass/index.htm">7-Day Pass</a> seems like a good deal, as it would cover both the airport-to-hotel and back trips (via MAX Light Rail), and all public transportation (bus/streetcar/light rail) in and around Portland.  (Single fare: $2.05; daypass: $4.20.) Rides within the downtown area <a href="http://www.trimet.org/fares/fareless.htm">"fareless square"</a> (which includes the hotel) are free. Visit <a href="http://www.trimet.org/index.htm">TriMet</a> for more public transit information.


<b><a href="http://www.portseattle.org/seatac/">Seattle</a></b>: You may also want to look into flights to Seattle and then taking a prop-job down to Portland. Seattle prices were less than half of PDX prices when I (eby) purchased saving even with the prop-job or drive down.



<h3>Local Arrangements</h3>

title: Code4lib 2008 Call for Proposals
created: 1193871353
---
We are now accepting proposals for prepared talks for Code4lib 2008. Code4lib 2008 is a loosely structured conference for library technologists to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be inspired, and forge collaborations. It is also an outgrowth of the Access HackFest, wrapped into a conference-like format. It is *the* event for technologists building digital libraries and digital information systems, tools, and software.
<!--break-->

The conference will be held February 25-28, 2008 in Portland Oregon. More information can be found at <http://code4lib.org/conference/2008>.

Prepared talks are 20 minutes, and must focus on one or more of the following areas:
- "tools" (some cool new software, software library or integration platform)
- "specs" (how to get the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones)
- "challenges" (one or more big problems we should collectively address).

The community will vote on proposals using the criteria of:
- usefulness
- newness
- geekiness
- diversity of topics.

We cannot accept every prepared talk proposal, but multiple lightning talk sessions will provide everyone who wishes to present with an opportunity to do so.

Please send your name, email address, and proposal of no more than 75 words to code4libcon at googlegroups.com. The proposal deadline is November 30, 2007, and proposers will be notified by December 14, 2007.

Faceted navigation, which is an increasingly common feature of library OPACS, was initially developed to browse hierarchical data. MARC data however, has relatively little hierarchy, and user-generated tags have even less. The flatness of this data, makes the navigation of search result-sets cumbersome and often ineffective. BiblioCommons has been tracking academic research and industry best-practices in this realm, and experimenting with different methods of adding structure to these datasets. This session will share learning to date.

<b>Aaron Swartz</b> - Tech Lead, Open Library<br />
The Open Library project (demo.openlibrary.org) is a collaboration between publishers, libraries, booklovers, and technologists to create a wiki with a page for every book. So far, we've been parsing Library of Congress records, ONIX feeds, Amazon pages, and more. And all the code and data used along the way is completely open. We'll discuss the project's goals, what we've built so far, and how you can help.

<b>Dan Scott</b> - Laurentian University<br />
CouchDB has gained buzz in the last year as an ad-hoc, schema-free, web-friendly data store. Slapstick hilarity results when a self- confessed relational database bigot experiments with CouchDB and reports on the good, the bad, and the meh. Translation into serious-ese: I will introduce CouchDB, show how one or more applications interact with it, and share any "wows" or "gotchas" that I ran into.

Using Ruby on Rails, we built a web page publishing system. The system allows librarians with minimal technical expertise to create dynamic pages that integrate Web 2.0 features with traditional library content. Students use the pages to connect quickly to selected library resources. We'll discuss why we chose a custom solution, give an overview of our agile development processes, and then look under the hood.

The DLF ILS Discovery Interface Task Force was charged with creating a technical proposal that would provide standardized integration between integrated library systems and external applications, better enabling libraries to replace their OPAC with an external discovery system. This talk would provide background for the project and an overview of the recommendation (hopefully published by code4lib 2008), as well as address how the library developer community can contribute to API implementation. More information and current work on the recommendation are available: https://project.library.upenn.edu/confluence/display/ilsapi/Home. A breakout session could facilitate further feedback and discussion of next steps.

I've been doing a lot of work around extracting as much meaning as possible from Marc records, using RDF as the data structure. Marc is a record-centric format, the result is anything but, with the RDF allowing rich relationships to form in the data that can then be used to drive different navigation techniques. This is about making the most of what is in Marc data to do something new.

The software has since progressed into an open source project known as VuFind. In this presentation I will talk about architecture and design decisions that were made to turn VuFind into a viable open source project and what future plans are in store, as well as how making the project open source has aided the project (and put me into project leader overtime).

We've recently hacked an API for the NYPL Digital Gallery to share images with the video collaboration platform, Kaltura. This could be your library's dream, or nightmare, depending where you sit. Is there a sweet spot between offering lightweight APIs - with possibly limited reliability - vs. trying to develop a bullet-proof API? Is the possible solution to seed the API to interested parties through feeds, with the implied expectation that it's a work in progress?

I will discuss MARCThing, a self-contained web service which aims to do for MARC and Z39.50 what Solr did for searching. MARCThing can run off a thumb drive, but is powerful enough to handle the needs of a large site like LibraryThing.com. It was designed to free developers from the complexity of MARC and Z39.50 and their idiosyncrasies in the real world.

The &#220;mlaut is an open source OpenURL middleware layer intended to improve the link resolving chain by analyzing incoming citations and intelligently querying resources to better enable access to them. The &#220;mlaut takes multiple approaches for locating items such as conference proceedings, preprints, postprints and gray literature utilizing search engines, Amazon, social citation managers and more. By utilizing the Worldcat registry, it is also personalizable and geospatially aware of available collections allowing access to all resources available to the user beyond the subscriptions of the &#220;mlaut's host institution. This talk will cover the history, architecture and community of this project.

This talk proposes to introduce the DCMI/RDA task group, formed to analyze the relationship of RDA to other metadata communities and to examine the modeling of library metadata. Recent DCMI developments will be discussed, including the DC Abstract Model, Application Profiles, RDF declarations of metadata element sets and value vocabularies, the Singapore Framework, and the emerging concept of description set profiling. It is hoped that this will help to foster collaboration between code4lib and DCMI.

Second Life is web-enabled via XML-RPC and HTTP so that it can automatically export data out from
scripted 3D objects and import in from Web databases. Its hackability is under-reported in favor of tales about naked avatars and case studies of failed ad campaigns but we think this platform may be useful for hybrid 3D modules for ILS systems. Two mashup projects will be interesting to library coders:
<ul>
<li> Sloodle.org connects Moodle to 3D learning tools</li>
<li> the Salamander project is organizing a 3D learning objects taxonomy related to Merlot.org (http://tinyurl.com/2pvqp9).</li>
</ul>
The two founders will describe their projects and give tips for hacking SL.

<b>David Walker</b> - California State University
David Walker, from California State University, will show a prototype that uses the new OCLC Grid Services WorldCat API. The presentation will detail the newly released WorldCat API, examining its strengths and weaknesses. The prototype will include some examples of how libraries might integrate the API with their local systems in order to build a custom WorldCat interface designed specifically for their users.

As distributing metadata creation to authors, catalogers and other system users who may or may not have an understanding of XML becomes more and more important it has become imperative to develop reliable methods for creating and editing XML documents. This presentation will focus on the two MODS editors developed by UVM and Brown Universities and introduce the XForms technology as a means for digital libraries to create and manage complex metadata.

Traditionally (if two years can be called tradition) we hold a contest to pick the design for the front of the conference t-shirt. This year we did not receive many entries - in fact, we only had one official entry. Fortunately, it rocks (at least, I think so):

<ul>
<li><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2795023253981109322&hl=en">View Video on Google Video</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rails.vim.tpope.net/">The rails.vim plugin home page</a> (See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30P8DSNOZuU">the YouTube demo</a>, an <a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/rubyonrails/ss/railsvim.htm">About.com tutorial</a>, or <a href="http://biodegradablegeek.com/2007/12/using-vim-as-a-complete-ruby-on-rails-ide/">another tutorial</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://media.peden.biz/docs/vim.tgz">This file (vim.tgz)</a> contains my .vimrc, my .vim folder (containing the rails.vim, project.vim, minibufexpl.vim, and other plugins), .screenrc and split screen file. Notes:
 <ul>
  <li>My .vimrc file is set up for the following:
   <ul>
    <li>To close a buffer, use :BD, not :q. The latter does not account for window layout.
    <li>Ctrl-h,j,k,l is mapped to switch windows. Normally you'd hit Ctrl-w followed by h,j,k,l.
    <li>To avoid having to save a file every time you switch a buffer, autowrite is enabled, meaning a file is saved when you move away from it.
    <li>F12 toggles the project window, F8 toggles the tag window.
    <li>Ctags is expected for taglist.vim. Uninstall as needed.
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using .screenrc and .screenrc.split: None of this needs to be changed much, and tutorials on Gnu screen are ubiquitous on the web. .screenrc.split shows how to start your server, split the screen, tail the development log, and start vim. To use, call screen -c ~/.screenrc.split in your rails directory.
  <li>Notes:
   <ul>
    <li>When you open a file from the minibuf area or the project area, the file will open in the last window used. This can really screw things up if you've moved from tags to project, etc. This is the major weakness of vim as an IDE, but you can be more aware of where you move.
    <li>The rails.vim plugin is only activated if you open a file in a rails application.
    <li>You may want to update all of the plugins. Ruby and rails syntax files can be updated with 'sudo gem install vim-ruby --remote'.

Registration for the conference, to be held in Toronto June 25-27 2008 is now open. To find out more about the meeting, to register, or to learn about accommodations and travel options, please visit our website at:    <a href="http://www.elpub.net">http://www.elpub.net</a>

ELPUB has a reputation for providing a relaxed yet stimulating venue for
discussion on diverse aspects of scholarly communications and publishing. In order to keep with past ELPUB tradition, conference enrollment is limited to 200 individuals (including speakers). We encourage you to register online as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.

*Early bird fee is closed on April 30th, 2008.*

We look forward to welcoming you to Toronto this June!

About ELPUB 2008:
Scholarly communications, and in particular scholarly publications, are
undergoing tremendous changes. Researchers, universities, funding bodies, research libraries and publishers are responding in different ways, from active experimentation with new models and adaptation of existing practices, to strong resistance or rejection of new communication methods. ELPUB 2008 will focus on a number of key issues surrounding the future of scholarly communications that arise as a result of the intersection of semantic web technologies, the development of cyberinfrastructure for the humanities and the sciences, and new dissemination channels and business models.

The three-day event will begin with a full day of technical workshops. The following two days will feature contributed papers examining a broad range of technical, conceptual, policy, and financial aspects of scholarly communication. Poster presentations and demonstrations of new publishing and research tools will form part of the program. A plenary session on funding and access policies for publicly funded research, and a special session on open access developments in transitional and developing countries will round out the program. The conference will begin and end with special keynotes by John Willinsky and Stevan Harnad.

The final agenda for the conference will be available online in late March,after the peer-review of submitted papers has been completed and acceptances have been confirmed.

Ever since Ed Summers (edsu) created the LinkedIn group for Code4Lib, requests to join have been flooding in. We're now at 210 members, but it hasn't shown many signs of slowing down yet. I try to get to the requests to join on a regular basis, but with vacation and all if you don't get accepted right away feel free to send me an email.

I received the following email today, which is in reference to the Code4Lib group on LinkedIn:

<p>First of all, thank you for your management of your group on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>In the past few weeks, we've made some changes with Groups. We introduced a new searchable directory in July, and last Thursday, we made some changes to the group management tools.</p>

<p>Both releases were part of a major change for Groups that we have been planning for several months. We've been talking to both group owners and members and looking at the great groups you have already built. I think we all see great potential for what Groups could be.</p>

<p>But in order to get there, we had to move to a new Groups platform. There was simply no way we could provide the tools you need to serve your members (and ours) with the old system. We made that switch last Thursday.</p>

<p>Some of you wrote in immediately to let us know about problems you encountered after the switch. Thank you for letting us know. I'm happy to say we have some of the problems fixed, but we still have several left to go. We know that these are serious issues and ask for your patience as we work through them.</p>

<p>Here's what we're doing:<br>
<ul>
<li>This week: Showing email addresses on the requests to join list in the management tool so you can verify where members are coming from and easily send them a welcome message.</li>
<li>Next week: Increasing the number of members shown in the management tool from 100 to 1,000 and increasing the number of members per page from 20 to 50; adding email addresses to the members list; adding date field to the CSV export feature; adding CSV export feature to requests to join list; increasing the CSV export limit from 10,000 to 50,000.</li>
<li>Also next week: We'll enable home pages for group members and some other group collaboration features.</li>
<li>In the weeks following: Sorting by date and name, and expansion to longer member lists, search by email address, and additional management capabilities throughout the rest of 2008.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're looking forward to the future of LinkedIn Groups and would like you to help shape the direction. I've asked two questions on LinkedIn Answers. Please contribute as I am looking forward to your feedback.<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers/using-linkedIn/ULI/301974-4805251">What are the key features you need to manage your LinkedIn group?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers/using-linkedIn/ULI/301975-4805251">How can LinkedIn Groups managers best work with each other and LinkedIn?</a></li>

We want to introduce you to a new group convening in the NYC area: Code4LibNYC.  

We are aspiring to start a local version of the Code4lib national organization. We want to provide a forum where library technologists can share information about library technology and discuss their current projects.  Our group is open to all library staff interested in the coding, deployment, and design of library software, systems, and web services. 

This local chapter of Code4Lib, known as Code4LibNYC, aspires to channel the spirit of the national organization. We want to provide a forum for software and web developers and programmers, working at libraries, to discuss their ongoing projects. We focus on development issues surrounding the following types of library services and tools: content management systems, web application frameworks, digital library systems, institutional repositories, subject repositories, federated search tools, and next generation OPACs. We look at the protocols and programming tools that power these types of applications. Many of our members have a strong interest in open source software. Group membership includes systems librarians, web services librarians, digital library developers, digital library managers, and systems-inclined library staff.  Please see METRO's page for additional information at <a href="http://www.metro.org/collaborate/index.php/Code4libNYC">http://www.metro.org/collaborate/index.php/Code4libNYC</a>.

We hope you can attend our first meeting at the METRO offices (<a href="http://www.metro.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20&Itemid=228">directions</a>) on East 11th street from 10 a.m. - 12:00 noon on Wednesday, September 10th.    

Please contact us us if you are interested in attending or have questions about this new group. 
 * Kevin Reiss (KReiss@gc.cuny.edu)
 * Paul Albert (paa2013@med.cornell.edu)
 * Joanna DiPasquale (jd2481@columbia.edu)

Additionally, we will keep Code4Lib updated about the group, including more mundane things like scheduling and meeting formats.  (We hope that we can share these experiences so that other local Code4Lib groups can benefit -- and are looking forward to hearing from those groups, too.)

A few people decided to fix the existing bugs in the solr python client and release it with unit tests, and some more documentation...and make it available via the <a href="http://python.org/pypi/solrpy">Cheeseshop</a>. To support this the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/solrpy">solrpy</a> Google Code project was created. There probably won't be tons of changes but if you use python and solr together you might be interested in using it, and subscribing to the discussion list.

In case you haven't seen the <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/code4lib%40listserv.nd.edu/msg03905.html">discussion</a> on the code4lib list, the New England chapter of code4lib is pulling itself up from its own bootstraps. They're self-organizing using a <a href="http://ne.code4lib.org">wiki</a> and are currently <a href="http://dilettantes.code4lib.org/voting_booth/election/index/5">voting on a venue</a> for the first meeting. 

If you are interested in starting your own local chapter, check out (and make better) the new <a href="http://code4lib.org/local">code4lib local</a> page.

<img src="http://code4lib.org/files/drupalicon.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">

<p>Darien Library will be hosting a <a href="http://drupalib.interoperating.info/drupal4libcamp">Drupal4Lib Camp</a> on Friday, February 27, 2009 from 9 am to 4 pm. It just so happens this is the day after <a href="http://code4lib.org/2009">code4lib2009</a> ends in nearby Providence, RI -- so you can theoretically hop on over after code4lib proper ends.</p>

<p>The camp will be an opportunity for libraries who are working with <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, or interested in implementing Drupal, to get together, share experiences, solve problems, and collaborate. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> will be a combination of a series of 10 min lightning talks given by Drupal veterans in the morning followed by break-out sessions in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Audio and video from Drupal4Lib Camp sessions will also be streamed lived online. There is no registration fee. However, participation is limited to 70.  Please <a href="http://drupalib.interoperating.info/node/167">register</a> for the Drupal4Lib Camp.</p>

We have 8 pre-conferences for <a rel="swc:isSubEventOf" href="/conference/2009/">code4lib2009</a> -- 2 full day and 6 half day. The plan is to charge a flat $25 pre-conference fee to cover room and break costs. Plan to arrive at morning sessions beginning at 8:30 am, and afternoon sessions beginning at 1.

Two 12-passenger shuttles circling between the Renaissance and Brown will run 7:45-9:45, 11:45-1:45, 4:15-6:15. Some may prefer to walk; allow at least 20 minutes for the 1 mile walk to the John Hay Library, or 30 minutes for the 1.5 miles to the Inn at Brown.  Maps will be available.

        The goals of this full-day workshop are to give participants a firm grounding in a variety of OCLC-provided APIs as well as the protocols upon which they are based (e.g., SRU, CQL). APIs to be highlighted will include the WorldCat Search API, xID services (xISBN, xISSN, and xOCLCNUM), WorldCat Identities, Terminologies, and others. All of these services are free to OCLC cataloging institutions. Besides learning about these services directly from the people involved with building them, you will have time to use them while having the experts in the room to answer questions and assist. You will emerge an expert in using a rich array of library APIs that can be used to enhance your local services. <br />

<h3><strong>Morning Pre-conferences</strong></h3>
<ul>
<a name="xml"></a>
      <li> <strong>XML In Libraries</strong><br />
        XML is about distributing data and information unambiguously. Through this hands-on workshop participants will learn: 1) what XML is, and 2) how it can be used to build library collections and faciliate library services in our globally networked environment. I have given this workshop quite a number of times in other venues, and the complete online version is available at the following URL: <a href="http://infomotions.com/musings/xml-in-libraries/">http://infomotions.com/musings/xml-in-libraries/</a>      <br />

<ul>
<li><strong>Koha</strong><br />
We intend to show you how to get the most out of (or into) Koha, open source ILS.  Without attempting to be a comprehensive ILS demo, we will discuss software components used by Koha and how they are applied to problems like searching, internationalization, customization, 3rd party content, automation, etc.  Participants should bring laptops and will receive access to a stock Koha installation for experimentation (if they opt not to use their own).<br /><br />

After seeing how Koha works, you then get to break it, or make it work differently, perhaps better.  The distributed version control Git will be introduced, including how to use it to make a change, generate a patch, and send it for inclusion in the mainline Koha project.  Similarly we will show how to use Git to keep your repositories updated, even when you have local changes.  Koha developers will be on hand to help you get your git on, and otherwise answer the question "How do I make Koha do X?"

<a name="fedora"></a>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Fedora: a look under the hood</strong><br />
        This half-day workshop will provide an opportunity to examine the inner workings of Fedora 3 and its new Content Model Architecture (CMA). Topics to be covered include ingestion of objects, access policy implementation, internal messaging services, creation of content models and their association to objects, as well as the API-A and API-M interfaces. Dan Davis of the Fedora Commons ( <a href="http://www.fedora.info/">http://www.fedora.info/</a>) will lead this investigation.<br />

</ul>
<a name="gis"></a>
<ul>
      <li><strong>Build an open-source GIS infrastructure just like Mother used to make!<br />
        </strong>Participants should bring laptops (*nix very much preferred, minimal support for Windows) We'll discuss, build up, and play with a stack of open-source tools that will provide a complete geospatial-data infrastructure, including data and metadata repositories and J2EE service layer (web-tier). Then we'll take our new gear out for a spin by building first a simple online mapping application and then a more complex webapp which combines geospatial and bibliographic data. <br />

title: Calling all Code4Libers Attending Midwinter

If you're active in Code4Lib and you'll be attending ALA Midwinter in Denver in January, put this on your meeting calendar:

LITA Town Hall Meeting, Monday, January 26, 8:00am - 10:00am (includes breakfast!)

Michelle Frisque says "At this years Town Meeting we are going to have a discussion about LITA’s place in a larger information, association, and community building technology related landscape. I am in the process of contacting people from organizations that share this landscape and I am asking if they would like to participate in this discussion with us. Code4Lib is one of the organization we identified."

So if you can make it, I'd appreciate other folks being there. As I told Michelle, "Code4Lib is an “un” organization — it has no structure and no leadership (or to be more specific, no leadership positions, anyone is considered to be and can be a leader). So having said that, I am willing to participate simply as one of many Code4Lib participants, and someone who could talk about what it is, how it functions, why people congregate there, etc. But I will not be “representing” the community per se." The more of us who show up and participate, the better LITA will understand this.

We're excited to announce the publication of the fifth issue of the Code4Lib Journal. Check out our 1 year anniversary issue! And with the upcoming Code4Lib conference, don't forget to scroll down to the bottom for Noel Peden's special report on what it takes to get good conference video.

Here's the table of contents:

<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/657">‡biblios: An Open Source Cataloging Editor</a>
Chris Catalfo

‡biblios is an open source cataloging editor designed to allow libraries to perform copy and original cataloging in a web based environment. ‡biblios allows users to search for, edit, and save bibliographic records in the MARC21/MARCXML formats. It also allows users to send records directly to integrated library systems such as the Koha ILS. Where most MARC editors are part of an integrated library system (and therefore require logging in), ‡biblios allows users to catalog with an open source standalone system available anywhere via a web browser. Unlike other cataloging editors, it offers an attractive user interface for searching, saving and editing cataloging records. This article describes the system architecture and design of ‡biblios.

<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/561">User-Centred Design and Agile Development: Rebuilding the Swedish National Union Catalogue</a>
Henrik Lindström and Martin Malmsten

With a new generation of OPACs emerging that attempt to address longstanding shortcomings, how do we make sure that we do not lose ground again in the future? This article suggests a combination of iterative development and user-centred design as a way to develop systems that will meet the constantly changing expectations of users by providing both functionality and usability. It gives a short introduction to iterative software development and user-centred design. A case study of the development of the new version of LIBRIS (http://libris.kb.se), the Swedish National Union Catalogue, is used as an example of how these methodologies can benefit from each other in practice.

<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/490">Reaching Users Through Facebook: A Guide to Implementing Facebook Athenaeum</a>
Wayne Graham

Facebook Athenaeum is an open source application that integrates library resources directly into the Facebook website. Facebook is one of the single most-visited websites in the world, and its popularity among college-aged students provides a unique opportunity for libraries to redefine how they interact with students. This article walks you through the deployment Facebook Athenaeum, and discusses some of the usage trends and pitfalls of deploying applications using the Facebook API.

<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/501">Affinity Strings: Enterprise Data for Resource Recommendations</a>
Cody Hanson, Shane Nackerud, and Kristi Jensen

The University of Minnesota Libraries have created a MyLibrary portal, with databases and e-journals targeted to users, based on their affiliations. The University’s enterprise authentication system provides an “affinity string”, now used to personalize the MyLibrary portal. This affinity string automates discovery of a user’s relationship to the University–describing a user’s academic department and degree program or position at the University. Affinity strings also provide the Libraries with an anonymized view of resource usage, allowing data collection that respects users’ privacy and lays the groundwork for automated recommendation of relevant resources based on the practices and habits of their peers.

<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/775">Identifying FRBR Work-Level Data in MARC Bibliographic Records for Manifestations of Moving Images</a>
Kelley McGrath and Lynne Bisko

The library metadata community is dealing with the challenge of implementing the conceptual model, Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR). In response, the Online Audiovisual Catalogers (OLAC) created a task force to study the issues related to creating and using FRBR-based work-level records for moving images. This article presents one part of the task force’s work: it looks at the feasibility of creating provisional FRBR work-level records for moving images by extracting data from existing manifestation-level bibliographic records. Using a sample of 941 MARC records, a subgroup of the task force conducted a pilot project to look at five characteristics of moving image works. Here they discuss their methodology; analysis; selected results for two elements, original date (year) and director name; and conclude with some suggested changes to MARC coding and current cataloging policy.

<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/469">Rasmuson Library DVD Browser: Fun with Screen Scraping and Drupal</a>
Ilana Kingsley and Mark Morlino

The DVD Browser is a simple application that lets library patrons browse movie covers, titles, and reviews. It works by screen scraping the the Rasmuson Library catalog for DVD movies and dumps the data into a Drupal MySQL database. This paper describes the process of setting up the DVD Browser.

<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/685">Reviving Digital Projects</a>
Dianne Dietrich, Jennifer Doty, Jen Green and Nicole Scholtz

What do you do when you are in charge of assessing and reviving an abandoned digital project you had no part in creating or implementing? This article will talk about the unique challenges and issues involved in such a project, drawing from a specific example at the University of Michigan Library. We contended with unfamiliar software, limited technical documentation, proprietary file formats and platform migration, and will discuss how we approached each of these specific technical issues. After reviving our project and reflecting on our process, we put together a list of guidelines that we feel will help assist others who may find themselves in similar situations.

<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/535">Generating Metadata on a Shoestring sans Programmer, with Our Good Friend, Excel (or Any Spreadsheet)</a>
Jill Strass

How to use Excel to generate metadata for any encoded filename or identifier for any digital object whose attributes can be expressed in an abbreviated form.

<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/555">SPECIAL REPORT: Creating Conference Video</a>
Noel F. Peden

Capturing video at a conference is easy. Doing it so the product is useful is another matter. Many subtle problems come into play so that video and audio obtained can be used to create a final product. This article discusses what the author learned in the two years of shooting and editing video for Code4Lib conference.

<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/527">COLUMN: We Love Open Source Software. No, You Can’t Have Our Code</a>
Dale Askey

Librarians are among the strongest proponents of open source software. Paradoxically, libraries are also among the least likely to actively contribute their code to open source projects. This article identifies and discusses six main reasons this dichotomy exists and offers ways to get around them.

created: 1233166632
permalink: /conference/2009/breakout/
---
Those interested in the same project/problem can hang out in a space together for 70 minute blocks. Generally the person who suggests the topic will take on the role as moderator to begin and moderate the discussion. Anyone can propose a breakout session - please think about whether you would want a session to be held on Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on the <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2009/schedule">order of talks</a> and who you hope will attend. There are five rooms available each day, including the large meeting room, and we will route different proposed sessions to the different rooms depending on a quick show-of-hands survey just before each one begins.

This page will list any sessions proposed before the conference itself, but there will also be flip charts outside the meeting room where more sessions can be proposed.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://roytennant.com/JohnHaylibrary.jpg"><img width="300" height="225" src="http://roytennant.com/JohnHaylibrary_s.jpg" border="0" align="right" /></a>The goals of this full-day workshop are to give participants a firm grounding in a variety of OCLC-provided APIs as well as the protocols upon which they are based (e.g., SRU, CQL). APIs to be highlighted will include the WorldCat Search API, xID services (xISBN, xISSN, and xOCLCNUM), WorldCat Identities, Terminologies, and others. All of these services are free to OCLC cataloging institutions. Besides learning about these services directly from the people involved with building them, you will have time to use them while having the experts in the room to answer questions and assist. You will emerge an expert in using a rich array of library APIs that can be used to enhance your local services. </p>

Lightning talks on are scheduled on all three days of the conference.  A lightning talk is a fast paced 5 minute talk on a topic of your choosing. If you'd like to do a lightning talk please add your name and topic to the flipchart that will be available at the conference. You can do more than one if you want, but if the slots fill up (there are 39 of them) you might have to choose which one you want to do.

<!-- BREAK -->

Mark Jason Dominus has a nice page <a href="http://perl.plover.com/lt/lightning-talks.html">about lightning talks</a>, which includes this summary of why you might want to do one:

<em>Maybe you've never given a talk before, and you'd like to start small. For a Lightning Talk, you don't need to make slides, and if you do decide to make slides, you only need to make three.</em>

<em>Maybe you're nervous and you're afraid you'll mess up. It's a lot easier to plan and deliver a five minute talk than it is to deliver a long talk. And if you do mess up, at least the painful part will be over quickly.</em>

<em>Maybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a question, or invite people to help you with your project, or boast about something you did, or tell a short cautionary story. These things are all interesting and worth talking about, but there might not be enough to say about them to fill up thirty minutes.</em>

<em>Maybe you have a lot of things to say, and you're already going to give a long talk on one of them, and you don't want to hog the spotlight. There's nothing wrong with giving several Lightning Talks. Hey, they're only five minutes.</em>

Editorial Introduction - Issue 6
Christine Schwartz
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1376

The intelligent use of technology in libraries continues to be one of our most crucial challenges. For those of us who became librarians because we loved to explore the book stacks, we are now finding new ways to explore both old and new content in digital form. With issue 6 of the Code4Lib Journal we hope you will find new ways to explore, experiment, and bring to your library users what they want and need.

Using OAI-ORE to Transform Digital Repositories into Interoperable Storage and Services Applications 
David Tarrant, Ben O'Steen, Tim Brody, Steve Hitchcock, Neil Jefferies and Leslie Carr
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1062

In the digital age libraries are required to manage large numbers of diverse objects. One advantage of digital objects over fixed physical objects is the flexibility of ‘binding’ them into publications or other useful aggregated intellectual entities while retaining the ability to reuse them independently in other contexts. An emerging framework for managing flexible aggregations of digital objects is provided by the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) with its work on Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE). This paper will show how OAI-ORE is being used to manage content in digital repositories, in particular institutional repositories, and has the potential ultimately to transform the conception of digital repositories.

Semi-automatic Citation Correction with Lemon8-XML 
MJ Suhonos
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1011

The Lemon8-XML software application, developed by the Public Knowledge Project (PKP), provides an open-source, computer-assisted interface for reliable citation structuring and validation. Lemon8-XML combines citation parsing algorithms with freely-available online indexes such as PubMed, WorldCat, and OAIster. Fully-automated markup of entire bibliographies may be a genuine possibility using this approach.
Automated markup of citations would increase bibliographic accuracy while reducing copyediting demands.

The Wise Use of Statistics in a Library-Oriented Environment 
Mathias Weyland
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1275

As with most businesses, libraries use statistics to justify expenses, to monitor the library’s expansion and to predict prospective developments. This article describes SQL and shell techniques for data retrieval as well as further processing of the data using the open source statistical environment R. The article emphasizes some of the pitfalls and reasoning errors librarians could easily slip into.
Having an academic background on statistics, the author is appointed to projects and tasks which need mathematical and statistical methods to be successfully accomplished.

Tree Representations: Graphics Libraries for Displaying Hierarchical Data 
Mark Wilhelm
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1083

Tree representations can be useful for presenting hierarchical data on the screen. In this article I’ll briefly describe building trees using the Dojo, Yahoo User Interface, Java Server Faces, and Google Web Toolkit libraries.

Visualizing Media Archives: A Case Study 
Chris Beer, Courtney Michael, and Mayo Todorovic
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1119

The WGBH Media Library and Archives is piloting an online media archive for scholarly research. In conversation with users, we have discovered they want to quickly pinpoint items relevant to their work and get an overview of collections and their relationships to other materials. To demonstrate the size and complexity of our collection to users in a meaningful way, WGBH is employing data visualization techniques to provide an interactive, graphical representation of the various relationships between items. This article discusses the techniques employed in implementing our relationship map, emphasizes the cataloging techniques required for this effort, and offers code and examples to spark discussion about ways to improve or extend this effort.

Course Views: A Scalable Approach to Providing Course-Based Access to Library Resources 
Jason Casden, Kim Duckett, Tito Sierra and Joseph Ryan
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1218

The NCSU Libraries’ Course Views project, along with a locally developed widget web service, improves course-based access to library collections and services by dynamically generating library course pages for all 6000+ courses at NCSU. By automatically generating custom content when possible and showcasing authored content when available, Course Views is able to achieve full course coverage without significantly increasing staff time to create and manage content. This paper will describe the system and the use of web services to achieve scalable and sustainable delivery of course-related library content.

Integrating Process Management with Archival Management Systems: Lessons Learned 
J. Gordon Daines, III and Cory L. Nimer
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1016

The Integrated Digital Special Collections (INDI) system is a prototype of a database-driven, Web application designed to automate and manage archival workflow for large institutions and consortia.
This article discusses the how the INDI project enabled the successful implementation of a process to manage large technology projects in the Harold B. Lee Library at Brigham Young University. It highlights how the scope of these technology projects is set and how the major deliverables for each project are defined. The article also talks about how the INDI system followed the process and still failed to be completed. It examines why the process itself is successful and why the INDI project failed. It further underscores the importance of process management in archival management systems.

How to Build an XML Web Client for the Gold Rush Link Resolver’s XML Gateway Web Services Layer 
Brian Kysela
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1324

The Gold Rush link resolver (GRLR) is part of a suite of programs developed by the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (CARL) which help manage a library’s electronic resources. It contains the essential features required to perform link resolution, and comes at a substantial discount compared to other commercial Link Resolvers.
After a comprehensive review of the available options, the library at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC) chose to implement Gold Rush over the summer of 2008. The UTC library also decided to take advantage of the release of the Gold Rush XML Gateway Web Services Layer by the Colorado Alliance in the spring of 2008. This article is a case study of how the UTC XML Web client was built and the steps necessary to successfully deploy such a client.

Using Book Data Providers to Improve Services to Patrons 
Mike Beccaria
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1009

At Paul Smith’s College, I recently implemented a “New Books” display using open APIs and an image scroller. In this article I’ll give a brief overview of Google Book Search, OpenLibrary and Worldcat, explain how I created this New Books Widget using book cover data, and provide readers with some practical and simple code to show how to collect this data. This article will be of interest to anyone who wants to read about a brief overview of current state of free book data service providers. Additionally, beginner programmers will likely find the examples at the end of the article helpful when getting started with projects of their own.

BOOK REVIEW: Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist 
Tom Keays 
http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1480

Written by two of the leading authorities on the semantic web, the “Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist” is a timely and thorough introduction to the topic. Covering RDF, RDFS, and OWL, the book takes a logical, trainerly approach, with practical and illuminating examples. Well worth a read.

<strong>Anders Söderbäck</strong>, National Library of Sweden

The promise of Linked Data is not that it is another way of aggregating data. For too long have library data been trapped within data-silos only accessible through obscure protocols. Why is access to library data still an issue? Letting everyone access and link to library data lets anyone build the next killer app. LIBRIS, the Swedish Union Catalogue is, since the beginning of this year, available as Linked Data. We discuss how and why.

Editorial Introduction - Code4Lib: Long May You Run by Tom Keays
<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1695">http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1695</a>

The Code4Lib Journal mirrors the diversity and depth of interests and expertise of its readership. Our successes, indeed, are yours.


How Hard Can it Be? : Developing in Open Source by Joann Ransom with Chris Cormack and Rosalie Blake
<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1638">http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1638</a>

In 2000 a small public library system in New Zealand developed and released Koha, the world's first open source library management system. This is the story of how that came to pass and why, and of the lessons learnt in their first foray into developing in open source.


Extracting User Interaction Information from the Transaction Logs of a Faceted Navigation OPAC by Cory Lown and Brad Hemminger
<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1633">http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1633</a>

This paper discusses the analysis of Apache web server logs from a faceted catalog interface (OPAC) at North Carolina State University. By grouping individual HTTP requests into user sessions and analyzing in that context, requests can be understood as particular user actions, with more specificity as to purpose and effect of an action. Client IP address and time are used as a sufficient proxy for determining user sessions from logs. Some initial exploratory findings of user behavior in the NCSU OPAC are provided, including that users make use of facets less than of text searching, and that some facet groups are used significantly more than others. Links are provided to the scripts used to make this session-based analysis, which could be modified for use with other facetted OPACs which use an Apache front-end.


Using a Web Services Architecture with Me, Myself and I by Stephen Meyer
<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1771">http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1771</a>

The UW-Madison Libraries Library Course Page system is used to deliver electronic reserves materials and course-focused library instruction webpages to students. As part of a rewrite of our system we broke the application into three component pieces: a file repository, a course timetable data service, and an interface application for building and viewing individual course pages. The new three-piece system was written with an inward facing service-oriented architecture that allowed us to choose the best technologies to solve each of the tasks the entire system needs to accomplish.


Deciphering Journal Abbreviations with JAbbr By Keith Jenkins
<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1758">http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1758</a>

JAbbr is an online tool developed at Cornell University to help users decipher journal title abbreviations. This article discusses why these abbreviations are so problematic, and how traditional tools are often insufficient, and then describes the novel approach used by JAbbr. Given an abbreviation, JAbbr creates a regular expression for fuzzy matching, tests it against a list of serial titles extracted from the library catalog, and returns a list of possible matches to the user.
JAbbr is available as a web site and as a web service.


Repurposing ProQuest Metadata for Batch Ingesting ETDs into an Institutional Repository by Shawn Averkamp and Joanna Lee
<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1647">http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1647</a>

This article describes the workflow used by the University of Iowa Libraries to populate their institutional repository and their catalog with the data collected by ProQuest UMI Dissertation Publishing during the submission of students' theses and dissertations. Re-purposing the metadata from ProQuest allowed the University of Iowa Libraries to streamline the process for ingesting theses and dissertations into their institutional repository The article includes a discussion of the benefits and limitations of the workflow described.


Bibliographic Metadata Extraction from Theses By Götz Hatop
<a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1686">http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1686</a>

This article presents the application of part-of-speech (POS) based statistical text analysis to the task of bibliographic metadata extraction from electronic dissertations. By using the approach described here it is possible to detect the title of a Ph.D. paper with an accuracy of about 80%. The accuracy measurements are done using a conceptually simple approach and implementation.

(Copied from the email sent out by Michael Giarlo earlier today.)

Yo code4lib, it's time to vote for keynote speakers for the code4lib 2010 conference: <a href="http://vote.code4lib.org/election/index/11">http://vote.code4lib.org/election/index/11</a>

The ballot will stay open through 11:59PM Eastern on Monday, October 5th.

<!--break-->

Next to each of the nominated keynote speakers, you'll find ranks ranging from 0 to 3: 0 indicating no interest in seeing a keynote by the nominee and 3 indicating heavy interest in seeing a keynote by the nominee.  You can change your rankings at any time until the ballot closes.

-Mike

P.S. You'll need to sign in with your code4lib.org site credentials to vote.  If you do not yet have an account on code4lib.org, go sign up for one!  New accounts require administrator approval and we get tons of spam accounts, so do us a favor and include your full real name, a job-related e-mail address, your website link, or some combination thereof when you sign up for an account.  Otherwise it can be difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff.  If your e-mail address ends in @mail.ru, we are likely to pass you over.  Feel free to send me (leftwing@alumni.rutgers.edu) a note if you've signed up for an account and we're slow to approve it; the "request new password" functionality might also be worth a click.

created: 1258432157

The opportunity to submit a proposal for a 20 minute prepared talk at the 2010 Code4Lib Conference in Asheville, NC has now closed. We received <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/2010talks_Submissions">47 great proposals</a> in what must surely be our best year ever for talk submissions.

<b><a href="http://vote.code4lib.org/election/index/13">Voting is now open</a></b> to anyone who has registered at <a href="http://code4lib.org/">code4lib.org</a> (accounts are available to anyone). Enter your code4lib login to enable voting. To vote, assign any number from 1 to three for any talk for which you wish to vote. You may change your vote at any time up until <b>voting closes at Midnight Eastern Standard Time on December 1</b>.
<!--break-->

When voting, please keep the following criteria in mind:
<ul>
<li>usefulness</li>
<li>newness</li>
<li>geekiness</li>
<li>diversity of topics</li>
</ul>

The proposals will be ranked based on the total number of votes, and will be slotted into available spaces in the conference schedule until the opportunities are exhausted. The current draft schedule allows for 17 talks, although the conference planning group (of which anyone can participate), may adjust it. In any case, it is likely that we will be unable to accommodate even half of the proposals.

If your proposal does not make the cut, please keep this in mind. We were overwhelmed this year with good proposals, and there will be many good talks that we will be forced to leave behind. Therefore, please consider giving a lightning talk instead.

<dt class="vevent">13:30-16:30 - <span class="summary">Afternoon Sessions</span></dt>

<strong>Full Day Pre-Conferences:</strong><br />
<ul>
<li>OCLC Web Services and Lightning Talk Demos - Roy Tennant, Karen Coombs, and Alice Sneary<br/><span class="links">Full day thorough coverage of a suite of APIs and the essentials about the underlying technologies (e.g., SRU, CQL, Atom, OpenSearch, etc.) to get you going right away. Handouts on each service covered will be distributed that outline the essential information about each service. There will also be time for you to show off what you've done to mashup library data in the past (not limited only to OCLC services), in a 5-10 minute presentation to help inspire ideas. </span></li>
<li>Koha - Brendan Gallagher and Ian Walls<br/><span class="links">Working on Koha bugs and enhancements, discussing best practices to solve common workflow and technical issues, developing helper scripts for data migration, connection to external systems, etc.</span></li>
<li>Serials Solutions - Andrew Nagy and Harry Kaplanian<br/><span class="links">Connecting Serials Solutions Fed Search, Link resolver or Summon to almost anything (such as OCLC, ILS systems, Drupal, whatever). Additionally, participants will have full access to the Summon API - providing search access to over 500 million academic documents. Serials Solutions staff will be on hand to answer questions and demonstrate various technologies.</span></li>
</ul>

<strong>Morning Pre-Conferences (09:00 - 12:00):</strong><br />
<ul>
<li>Solr White Belt - Bess Sadler<br/><span class="links">The journey of solr mastery begins with installation. We will then proceed to data types, indexing, querying, and inner harmony. You will leave this session with enough information to start running a solr service with your own data.</span></li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/erikhatcher/solr-black-belt-preconference">Solr Black Belt - Erik Hatcher and Naomi Dushay</a><br/><span class="links">Amaze your friends with your ability to combine boolean and weighted searching. Confound your enemies with your mastery of the secrets of dismax. Leave slow queries in the dust as you performance tune solr within an inch of its life.</span></li>
<li>Hacker 101/102 - Dan Chudnov<br/><span class="links">Are you an accidental hacker? Recent MLS grad who got handed all the web scripting duties because "those young people know all that stuff now"? Slid over from reference, tech services, or archives into "doing the tech stuff" because nobody else would? Humanities major who found a good job in the library but never wrote a lick of code before? Sole hacker in a sea of non-technical folks who never has anyone to look to for mentoring? Learned a lot on your own, but you still sometimes "just get stuck" at the same places in your code? If these descriptions sound like you, and you're coming to code4lib to build a better foundation of programming know-how for yourself, or you've already got some basics down and need to fill in some big gaps, this is the preconference for you. We'll cover some basic tenets of how code works and work through some fun, informative examples together. We'll also leave plenty of time for questions and will gear the session to what the people who attend want to learn. Bring a laptop - everyone will write some new code in this session. </span></li>
<li>Web Services & Widgets - Godmar Back and Annette Bailey<br/><span class="links">interactive workshop that explains how to create practical web services and widgets for libraries. The focus will be on creating web services for and integrating widgets into the services your library has already implemented and deployed (OPAC, Resolver, etc.). We will explain what is possible and how to do it, particularly for systems where librarians have limited or no control of the back-end. This workshop will be targeted at beginning-level programmers. Technologies covered will include advanced JavaScript/jQuery and JSON. </span></li>
</ul>

<strong>Afternoon Pre-Conferences (13:30 - 16:30):</strong><br />
<ul>
<li>Blacklight - Naomi Dushay, Jessie Keck, and Bess Sadler<br/><span class="links">Apply your solr skills to running Blacklight as a front end for your library catalog, institutional repository, or anything you can index into solr. We'll cover installation, source control with git, local modifications, test driving development, and writing object-specific behaviors. You'll leave this workshop ready to revolutionize discovery at your library. Solr white belts or black belts are welcome.</span></li>
<li>Evergreen - Bill Erickson<br/><span class="links">Update on development, plans for future development, clearing paths for community involvement, documentation project, what's up with acquisitions, general Q & A, and more. As code4lib heads South again, Evergreen developers, users, and advocates will be there to meet it. The discussion will be a mix of general and technical.</span></li>
<li>Hacker 201/202 - Dan Chudnov<br/><span class="links">Picking up where 101/102 leaves off, we'll apply what we cover in the morning to practical library situations. Parse MARC records; stuff XML metadata into a database; query that data with SQL; put up a web interface to that query; replace it all with a Solr backend; dress up the web page with CSS and JavaScript. (Note: we're not going to focus on Solr for very long; if you want to focus on Solr, go to the dedicated Solr preconf sessions!) Bring a laptop - everyone will write some new code in this session.</span></li>

We will propose that the code4lib community pursue the cloud4lib, a open digital library platform based on open source software and open services. This platform would provide common service layers for libraries, not only via code, but also allow libraries to easily utilize tools and systems through cloud services. Instead of a variety of competing cloud services and proprietary platforms, cloud4lib will attempt to be a unifying force that will allow libraries to be consumer of the services built on top of it as well as allow developers / researchers / code4lib'ers to hack, extend, and enhance the platform as it matures.</span></span></dt>

Klein [<a href="http://www.archive.org/details/PublicDatasetsInTheCloud-RosalynMetzAndMichaelB.Klein">Video</a>] [<a href="/conference/2010/metz_klein">Page</a>]<br /><span class="links">When most people think about cloud computing (if they think about it at all), it usually takes one of two forms: Infrastructure Services, such as Amazon EC2 and GoGrid, which provide raw, elastic computing capacity in the form of virtual servers, and Platform Services, such as Google App Engine and Heroku, which provide preconfigured application stacks and specialized deployment tools. Several providers, however, offer access to large public datasets that would be impractical for most organizations to download and work with locally. From a 67-gigabyte dump of DBpedia's structured information store to the 180-gigabyte snapshot of astronomical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, chemistry and biology to economic and geographic data, these datasets are available instantly and backed by enough pay-as-you-go server capacity to make good use of them. We will present an overview of currently-available datasets, what it takes to create and use snapshots of the data, and explore how the library community might push some of its own large stores of data and metadata into the cloud. </span>

It will cover basic usage of several python tools. No large stack traces, just the comfort of pure python and basic computational algorithms in a step-by-step presentation on dealing with an old library task: matching dirty data. While much literature exists on matching/merging duplicate bibliographic records, most of this literature does not specify how to accomplish the task, just reports on the efficiency of the tools used to accomplish the task, often within a larger system such as an ILS.

HIVE combines the ease of folksonomies with the rigor of traditional vocabularies. By combining semantic web standards with text mining techniques, HIVE will improve the effectiveness of subject metadata generation, allowing users to search and browse terms from a variety of vocabularies and ontologies. Documents can be submitted to HIVE to automatically generate suggested vocabulary terms. Your system can interact with common vocabularies such as LCSH and MESH via the central HIVE server, or you can install a local copy of HIVE with your own custom set of vocabularies. This talk will give an overview of the current features of HIVE and describe how to build tools that use the HIVE services. </span></span></dt>

In doing so we have conceived of the metadata application profile, a profile which provides instructions for software on how to edit metadata. We have built a set of web services and some web-based tools for editing metadata. The metadata application profile allows these tools to extend across different metadata schemes, and allows for different rules to be established for editing items of different collections. Some features of the tools include integration with authority lists, auto-complete fields, validation and clean integration of batch editing with Excel. I know, I know, Excel, but in the right hands, this is a powerful tool for cleanup and batch editing. In this talk, we want to introduce the concepts of the metadata application profile, and gather feedback on its merits, as well as demonstrate some of the tools we have developed and how they work together to manage the metadata in our Fedora repository.

To help make sense of the chaos, increase the transparency of the IT "black box," and shorten time lag between requirements definition and functional releases, we have implemented a modified Agile/SCRUM methodology within the development group in the IT department at NCSU Libraries. This presentation will provide a brief overview of the Agile methodology as an introduction to our simplified approach to iteratively handling multiple projects across a small team. This iterative approach allows us to regularly re-evaluate requested enhancements against institutional priorities and more accurately estimate timelines for specific units of functionality. The presentation will highlight how we approach each development cycle (from planning to estimating to re-aligning) as well as some of the actual tools and techniques we use to manage work (like JIRA and Greenhopper). It will identify some challenges faced in applying an established development methodology to a small team of multi-tasking developers, the outcomes we've seen, and the areas we'd like to continue improving. These types of iterative planning/development techniques could be adapted by even a single developer to help manage a chaotic workplace.

Sysadmins are charged with maintaining stability in the production environment, and so are often resistant to rapid upgrade cycles. This has traditionally pitted us against each other, but it doesn't have to be that way. Using tools like puppet for maintaining and testing server configuration, nagios for monitoring, and hudson for continuous code integration, UVA has brokered a peace that has given us the ability to maintain stable production environment with a rapid upgrade cycle. I'll discuss both the individual tools, our server configuration, and the social engineering that got us here. </span></span></dt>

Even with these similarities, media archives have additional issues that are less relevant to libraries: the choice of video players, large file sizes, proprietary file formats, challenges of time-based media, etc. In developing a web presence, many archives, including the WGBH Media Library and Archives, have created custom digital library applications to expose material online. In 2008, we began a prototyping phase for developing scholarly interfaces by creating a custom-written PHP front-end to our Fedora repository. In late 2009, we finally saw the (black)light, and after some initial experimentation, decided to build a new, public website to support our IMLS-funded /Vietnam: A Television History/ archive (as well as existing legacy content). In this session, we will share our experience of and challenges with customizing Blacklight as an archival interface, including work in rights management, how we integrated existing Ruby on Rails user-generated content plugins, and the development of media components to support a rich user experience. </span>

The migration was done over the course of 3 months, without assistance from either Innovative Interfaces, Inc. or any Koha vendor. The in-house script, written in Perl and XSLT, can be used with any Millennium installation, regardless of which modules have been purchased, and can be adapted to work for migration to systems other than Koha. Helper scripts were also developed to capture the current circulation state (checkouts, holds and fines), and do minor data cleanup. This presentation will cover the planning and scheduling of the migration, as well as an overview of the code that was written for it. Opportunities for systems integration and development made newly available by having an open source platform are also discussed. </span></span></dt>

We demo an instant index lookup feature that requires no search button and no page refreshes - and without ever leaving the search field.

NCSU Libraries has implemented a virtual shelf browse tool, re-creating the benefits of physical browsing in an online environment and enabling users to explore digital and physical materials side by side. We hope that this is a first step towards enabling patrons familiar with Amazon and Netflix recommendations to "find more" in the library. We will provide an overview of the architecture of the front-end application, which uses Syndetics cover images to provide a "cover flow" view and allows the entire "shelf" to be browsed dynamically. We will describe what we learned while wrangling multiple jQuery plugins, manipulating an ever-growing (and ever-slower) DOM, and dealing with unpredictable response times of third-party services. The front-end application is supported by a web service that provides access to a shelf-ordered index of our catalog. We will discuss our strategy for extracting data from the catalog, processing it, and storing it to create a queryable shelf order index. </span></span></dt>

Announcing a new chapter: <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/North">Code4Lib North</a>, for people in Ontario, Quebec, and nearby regions of the United States. 

A number of people from these places run into each other at Code4Lib, Access, and the Ontario Library Association and other conferences, or through work with the Ontario Council of University Libraries, or just in general geek circles.  Now we can plan to get together in true Code4Lib style! There is talk about a possible meet in Kingston in the spring. Kingston is convenient for people from the Golden Horseshoe, Ottawa, Montreal, Québec, and upstate New York.  

Anyone interested in being in the chapter can put their name down on the wiki page. There's no mailing list yet, but we'll make one when we need one. In the meantime we can discuss things on the main code4lib mailing list.

Those interested in the same project/problem can hang out in a space together for 70 minute blocks. Generally the person who suggests the topic will take on the role as moderator to begin and moderate the discussion. Anyone can propose a breakout session - please think about whether you would want a session to be held on Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on the <a href="/conference/2010/schedule">order of talks</a> and who you hope will attend. There are a lot of rooms available each day, including the large meeting room, and we will route different proposed sessions to the different rooms depending on a quick show-of-hands survey just before each one begins.

Lightning talks are scheduled on all three days of the conference.  A lightning talk is a fast-paced 5 minute talk on a topic of your choosing.

Needed: volunteer to ensure presentation files get added to this page.

<!-- BREAK -->

Mark Jason Dominus has a nice page <a href="http://perl.plover.com/lt/lightning-talks.html">about lightning talk</a>s, which includes this summary of why you might want to do one:

<em>Maybe you've never given a talk before, and you'd like to start small. For a Lightning Talk, you don't need to make slides, and if you do decide to make slides, you only need to make three.

Maybe you're nervous and you're afraid you'll mess up. It's a lot easier to plan and deliver a five minute talk than it is to deliver a long talk. And if you do mess up, at least the painful part will be over quickly.

Maybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a question, or invite people to help you with your project, or boast about something you did, or tell a short cautionary story. These things are all interesting and worth talking about, but there might not be enough to say about them to fill up thirty minutes.</em>

OCLC Web Services such as xISSN, WorldCat Search API, WorldCat Identities, and the WorldCat Registry provide a variety of data which can be used to enhance and improve current library interfaces. This talk will discuss several simple ideas to improve current users interfaces using data from these services.

Javascript and PHP code to add journal of table of contents information, peer-reviewed journal designation, links to other libraries in the area with a book, also available ..., and info about this author will be discussed.

Even though we'd love to get basic searches working so well that advanced search wouldn't be necessary, there will always be a small set of users that want it, and there will always be some library searching needs that basic searching can't serve. Our user interface designer was dissatisfied with many aspects of advanced search as currently available in most library discovery software; the form she designed was excellent but challenging to implement. See http://searchworks.stanford.edu/advanced We'll share details of how we implemented Advanced Search in Blacklight:

<ol>
<li>non-techie designed html form for the user</li>
<li>boolean syntax while using Solr dismax magic (dismax does not speak Boolean)</li>
<li>checkbox facets (multiple facet value selection)</li>
<li>fielded searching while using Solr dismax magic (dismax allows complex weighting formulae across multiple author/title/subject/... fields, but does not allow "fielded" searching in the way lucene does) - easily configured in solrconfig.xml </li>
<li>manipulating user entered queries before sending them to Solr</li>
<li>making advanced search results look like other search results: breadcrumbs, selectable facets, and other fun.</li>
</ol>

a.k.a. "Human Search Engine". A chance for you to ask a roomful of code4libbers anything that's on your mind: questions seeking answers (short or long), requests for things (hardware, software, skills, or help), or offers of things. We'll keep the pace fast, and the answers faster. Come with questions and line up at the start of the session and we'll go through as many as we can; sometimes we'll stop at finding the right person or people to answer a query and it'll be up to you to find each other after the session. First time at code4libcon! (Thanks to Ka-Ping Yee for the inspiration/explanation, reused here in part.)

On Sept. 1st, 2009, the NYU Health Sciences Libraries made the unprecedented move from their Millennium ILS to Koha. The migration was done over the course of 3 months, without assistance from either Innovative Interfaces, Inc. or any Koha vendor. The in-house script, written in Perl and XSLT, can be used with any Millennium installation, regardless of which modules have been purchased, and can be adapted to work for migration to systems other than Koha. Helper scripts were also developed to capture the current circulation state (checkouts, holds and fines), and do minor data cleanup.

This presentation will cover the planning and scheduling of the migration, as well as an overview of the code that was written for it. Opportunities for systems integration and development made newly available by having an open source platform are also discussed.

Major library vendors are creating proprietary platforms for libraries. We will propose that the code4lib community pursue the cloud4lib, a open digital library platform based on open source software and open services. This platform would provide common service layers for libraries, not only via code, but also allow libraries to easily utilize tools and systems through cloud services. Instead of a variety of competing cloud services and proprietary platforms, cloud4lib will attempt to be a unifying force that will allow libraries to be consumer of the services built on top of it as well as allow developers / researchers / code4lib'ers to hack, extend, and enhance the platform as it matures.

R is a popular, powerful, and extensible open source statistical analysis application. Rapache, software developed at Vanderbilt University, allows web developers to leverage the data analysis and visualization capabilities of R in real-time through simple Apache server requests. This presentation will provide an overview of both R and rapache and will explore how these tools might be used to develop applications for the library community.

The release of Drupal 7 brings with it a big increase in utility for this already very useful and well-accepted content management framework. Specifically, the addition of fields in core, the inclusion of RDFa, the use of the PHP_db abstraction layer, and the promotion of files to first class objects facilitate the development of richer applications directly in Drupal without the need to integrate external products.

With collections turning digital, and libraries transforming into collaborative spaces, the physical shelf is disappearing. NCSU Libraries has implemented a virtual shelf browse tool, re-creating the benefits of physical browsing in an online environment and enabling users to explore digital and physical materials side by side. We hope that this is a first step towards enabling patrons familiar with Amazon and Netflix recommendations to "find more" in the library.

We will provide an overview of the architecture of the front-end application, which uses Syndetics cover images to provide a "cover flow" view and allows the entire "shelf" to be browsed dynamically. We will describe what we learned while wrangling multiple jQuery plugins, manipulating an ever-growing (and ever-slower) DOM, and dealing with unpredictable response times of third-party services. The front-end application is supported by a web service that provides access to a shelf-ordered index of our catalog. We will discuss our strategy for extracting data from the catalog, processing it, and storing it to create a queryable shelf order index.

HIVE is a toolkit that assists users in selecting vocabulary and ontology terms to annotate digital content. HIVE combines the ease of folksonomies with the rigor of traditional vocabularies. By combining semantic web standards with text mining techniques, HIVE will improve the effectiveness of subject metadata generation, allowing users to search and browse terms from a variety of vocabularies and ontologies. Documents can be submitted to HIVE to automatically generate suggested vocabulary terms.

Your system can interact with common vocabularies such as LCSH and MESH via the central HIVE server, or you can install a local copy of HIVE with your own custom set of vocabularies. This talk will give an overview of the current features of HIVE and describe how to build tools that use the HIVE services.

Browsing bookshelves has long been a useful research technique as well as an activity many users enjoy. As larger and larger portions of our physical library materials migrate to offsite storage, having a browse-able virtual shelf organized by call number is a much-desired feature. I will talk about how we implemented nearby-on-shelf in Blacklight at Stanford, using Solr and SolrMarc:

<ol>
<li>the code to get shelfkeys out of call numbers</li>
<li>the code to lop volume data off the end of call numbers to avoid clutter in the browse</li>
<li>what I indexed in Solr given we have</li>
<ol>
<li>multiple call numbers for a single bib record</li>
<li>multiple bib records for a single call number </li>
</ol>
<li>Solr configuration, requests and responses to get call numbers before and after a given starting point as well as the desired information for display.</li>
<li>Other code needed to implement this feature in Blacklight (concepts easily ported to other UIs).</li>
</ol>

This virtual shelf is not only browsable across locations, but includes any item with a call number in our collection (digital or physical materials). 


Naomi says:  "Some of this code is available in SolrMarc trunk as of 2010-02-28, but with the upgrade to SolrMarc version 2.1, the stanfordBlacklight example will probably not be up to date for a few weeks.  The Blacklight part of the code will also be forthcoming."

How is it worth it to slow down your code development to write tests? Won't it take you a long time to learn how to write tests? Won't it take longer if you have to write tests AND develop new features, fix bugs? Isn't it hard to write test code? To maintain test code? We will address these questions as we talk about how test code is crucial for our software. By way of illustration, we will show how it has played a vital role in making Blacklight a true community collaboration, as well as how it has positively impacted coding projects in the Stanford Libraries.

With a small IT unit and a wide array of projects to support, requests for development from business stakeholders in the library can quickly spiral out of control. To help make sense of the chaos, increase the transparency of the IT "black box," and shorten time lag between requirements definition and functional releases, we have implemented a modified Agile/SCRUM methodology within the development group in the IT department at NCSU Libraries.

This presentation will provide a brief overview of the Agile methodology as an introduction to our simplified approach to iteratively handling multiple projects across a small team. This iterative approach allows us to regularly re-evaluate requested enhancements against institutional priorities and more accurately estimate timelines for specific units of functionality. The presentation will highlight how we approach each development cycle (from planning to estimating to re-aligning) as well as some of the actual tools and techniques we use to manage work (like JIRA and Greenhopper). It will identify some challenges faced in applying an established development methodology to a small team of multi-tasking developers, the outcomes we've seen, and the areas we'd like to continue improving. These types of iterative planning/development techniques could be adapted by even a single developer to help manage a chaotic workplace.

The increased use of mobile devices provides an untapped resource for delivering library resources to patrons. The mobile catalog is the next step for libraries in providing universal access to resources and information.

This talk will share Oregon State University (OSU) Libraries' experience creating a custom mobile catalog. The discussion will first make the case for mobile catalogs, discuss the context of mobile search, and give an overview of vendor and custom mobile catalogs. The second half of the talk will look under the hood of OSU Libraries' custom mobile catalog to provide implementation strategies and discuss tools, techniques, requirements, and guidelines for creating an optimal mobile catalog experience that offers services that support time critical and location sensitive activities.

Regular expressions is a powerful tool to identify matching data between similar files. When one or both of these files has inconsistent data due to differing character encodings or miskeying, the use of regular expressions to find matches becomes impractically complex.

The Levenshtein distance (LD) algorithm is a basic sequence comparison technique that can be used to measure word similarity more flexibly. Employing the LD to calculate difference eliminates the need to identify and code into regex patterns all of the ways in which otherwise matching strings might be inconsistent. Instead, a similarity threshold is tuned to identify close matches while eliminating false positives.

Recently, the UW Libraries began an effort to store Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD) in our institutional repository which runs on DSpace. We received 6,756 PDFs along with a file of UMI-created MARC records which needed to be matched to our library's custom MARC records (60,175 records). Once matched, merged information from both records would be used to create the dublin_core.xml file needed for batch ingest into DSpace. Unfortunately, records within the MARC data had no common unique identifiers to facilitate matching. Direct matching by title or author was impractical due to slight inconsistencies in data entry. Additionally, one of the files had "flattened" characters in title and author fields to ASCII. We successfully employed LD to match records between the two files before merging them.

This talk demonstrates one method of matching sets of MARC records that lack common unique identifiers and might contain slight differences in the matching fields. It will cover basic usage of several python tools. No large stack traces, just the comfort of pure python and basic computational algorithms in a step-by-step presentation on dealing with an old library task: matching dirty data. While much literature exists on matching/merging duplicate bibliographic records, most of this literature does not specify how to accomplish the task, just reports on the efficiency of the tools used to accomplish the task, often within a larger system such as an ILS.

There are many shared problems (and solutions) for libraries and archives in the interest of helping the user. There are also many "new" developments in the archives world that the library communities have been working on for ages, including item-level cataloging, metadata standards, and asset management. Even with these similarities, media archives have additional issues that are less relevant to libraries: the choice of video players, large file sizes, proprietary file formats, challenges of time-based media, etc. In developing a web presence, many archives, including the WGBH Media Library and Archives, have created custom digital library applications to expose material online. In 2008, we began a prototyping phase for developing scholarly interfaces by creating a custom-written PHP front-end to our Fedora repository.

In late 2009, we finally saw the (black)light, and after some initial experimentation, decided to build a new, public website to support our IMLS-funded /Vietnam: A Television History/ archive (as well as existing legacy content). In this session, we will share our experience of and challenges with customizing Blacklight as an archival interface, including work in rights management, how we integrated existing Ruby on Rails user-generated content plugins, and the development of media components to support a rich user experience.

We set out in the Trident project to create a metadata tool that scales. In doing so we have conceived of the metadata application profile, a profile which provides instructions for software on how to edit metadata. We have built a set of web services and some web-based tools for editing metadata. The metadata application profile allows these tools to extend across different metadata schemes, and allows for different rules to be established for editing items of different collections. Some features of the tools include integration with authority lists, auto-complete fields, validation and clean integration of batch editing with Excel. I know, I know, Excel, but in the right hands, this is a powerful tool for cleanup and batch editing.

In this talk, we want to introduce the concepts of the metadata application profile, and gather feedback on its merits, as well as demonstrate some of the tools we have developed and how they work together to manage the metadata in our Fedora repository.

When most people think about cloud computing (if they think about it at all), it usually takes one of two forms: Infrastructure Services, such as Amazon EC2 and GoGrid, which provide raw, elastic computing capacity in the form of virtual servers, and Platform Services, such as Google App Engine and Heroku, which provide preconfigured application stacks and specialized deployment tools. Several providers, however, offer access to large public datasets that would be impractical for most organizations to download and work with locally. From a 67-gigabyte dump of DBpedia's structured information store to the 180-gigabyte snapshot of astronomical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, chemistry and biology to economic and geographic data, these datasets are available instantly and backed by enough pay-as-you-go server capacity to make good use of them. We will present an overview of currently-available datasets, what it takes to create and use snapshots of the data, and explore how the library community might push some of its own large stores of data and metadata into the cloud.

<strong>Taking Control of Library Metadata and Websites Using the eXtensible Catalog</strong>

The eXtensible Catalog Project has developed four open-source software toolkits that enable libraries to build and share their own web- and metadata-focused applications on top of a service-oriented architecture that incorporates Solr in Drupal, a robust metadata management platform, and OAI-PMH and NCIP-compatible tools that interact with legacy library systems in real-time.

XC's robust metadata management platform allows libraries to orchestrate and sequence metadata processing services on large batches of metadata. Libraries can build their own services using the available "service-writers toolkit" or choose from our initial set of metadata services that clean up and "FRBRize" MARC metadata. Another service will aggregate metadata from multiple repositories to prepare it for use in unified discovery applications. XC software provides an RDA metadata test bed and a Solr-based metadata "navigator" that can aggregate and browse metadata (or data) in any XML format. XC's user interface platform is the first suite of Drupal modules that treat both web content and library metadata as native Drupal nodes, allowing libraries to build web-applications that interact with metadata from library catalogs and institutional repositories as well as with library web pages. XC's Drupal modules enable Solr in a FRBRized data environment, as a first step toward a full implementation of RDA. Other currently-available XC toolkits expose legacy ILS metadata, circulation, and patron functionality via web services for III, Voyager and Aleph (to date) using standard protocols (OAI-PMH and NCIP), allowing libraries to easily and regularly extract MARC data from an ILS in valid MARCXML and keep the metadata in their discovery applications "in sync" with source repositories.

This presentation will showcase XC's metadata processing services, the metadata "navigator" and the Drupal user interface platform. The presentation will also describe how libraries and their developers can get started using and contributing to the XC code.

A year later and how far has Linked Library Data come? With the emergence of large, centralized sources (id.loc.gov/authorities/, viaf.org, among others) entry to the Linked Data cloud might be easier than you think. This presentation will describe various projects that are out in the wild that can bridge the gap between our legacy data and the semantic web, incremental steps we can take modeling our data, why linked data matters and a demonstration of how a small template changes can contribute to the Linked Data cloud.

<strong>Vampires vs. Werewolves: Ending the War Between Developers and Sysadmins with Puppet</strong>

Developers need to be able to write software and deploy it, and often require cutting edge software tools and system libraries. Sysadmins are charged with maintaining stability in the production environment, and so are often resistant to rapid upgrade cycles. This has traditionally pitted us against each other, but it doesn't have to be that way. Using tools like puppet for maintaining and testing server configuration, nagios for monitoring, and hudson for continuous code integration, UVA has brokered a peace that has given us the ability to maintain stable production environment with a rapid upgrade cycle. I'll discuss both the individual tools, our server configuration, and the social engineering that got us here.

So Google Wave is a new shiny web toy, but did you know that it's also a great platform for collaboration and research? (I bet you did.) ...And what platform for collaboration and research would not be complete without some library tools to aid and abet that process? I will talk about how to take your library web services and integrate them with Google Wave to create bots that users can interact with to get at your resources as part of their social and collaborative work.

Map mashups, tag clouds and timelines can be used to show information to users in new ways and help them locate materials to meet their needs. QR codes can help link users to materials that libraries have in their collections. Charts and graphs can be used to help analyze library collections (holdings) and compare them to other libraries. This session will show prototypes which combine tools like Google Chart API, Protovis and Simile Widgets with data from WorldCat, WorldCat Registry, Classify, Terminology Services, and Dewey.info to create vivid illustrations in library user interfaces and administration tools.</span></span></dt>

With no frontrunner for one bibliographic data standard, and local requirements on what data will be accompanying or linked to the main record store, Kuali OLE needs to build a flexible environment for records management and access. We will present the concepts of our planned architecture, a multi-repository framework, using a document repository, a semantic repository, and a relational repository, brokered on top of the enterprise service bus of Kuali Rice. As a community source project, this is an opportunity for the Kuali OLE partners to present our plans for discussion with the community, and we look forward to feedback, questions, and comments. </span></span></dt>

The group -- several of whom hang their professional hats in libraries and most of whom were previously unacquainted -- was asked to spend one week together brainstorming, specifying, building, publicizing, and releasing an open source software tool of use to the digital humanities community. The result was Anthologize, a free, open source plugin that transforms WordPress into a platform for publishing electronic texts in formats including PDF, ePub, and TEI; in other words, a "blog-to-book" tool.</span></span></dt>

This talk will describe a work-in-progress project at the Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System to migrate its aging search platform to Invenio, an open-source institutional repository and digital library system originally developed at CERN, while at the same time incorporating Solr as an external component for both faceting and fulltext search. </span></span></dt>

Since then, CouchDB has passed the 1.0 mark and landed on desktops, the cloud, and mobile devices. With the advent of CouchApps (web apps served directly from CouchDB) applications can be built that are as easy to install as the replicating of databases (which is super easy!). I'll discuss the advantages and challenges in designing a CouchApp to be used as a catalog, repository, or directory of resources. Some things are made fairly simple, such as site templating, the outputting of documents in different formats, and the attachment of binary objects to documents. Some things, like document versioning and the modeling of data, are a little trickier, but still straightforward. And some things, such as granular authentication and the integration of search, are tangled enough to produce some head-on-wall banging. But hey, take it easy. It’s time to relax.

The MST is an open-source Java application, that uses SOLR and MySQL to harvest (OAI-PMH) library metadata (MARC, DC), clean it up, convert and frbrize, and then make new metadata (RDA flavor, XC Schema) available for harvesting. Our first release performed too slowly with degrading performance with large record batches and we needed to enable the MST to process a library’s entire catalog in a reasonable amount of time on a common server. The MST was also intended to be extensible. Libraries will almost certainly want to customize this process in some way. Thus our second goal was to make it is as easy as possible for a developer to write a service which can be plugged into the MST. </span></span></dt>

This is fantastic if the library website is the one place your users go for library information. But it isn't. Users are going to Facebook, checking mobile applications, browsing portals as well as checking the library website. Wouldn't it be great if you could update the information on all of these sites from a single source? Why maintain the library hours in five different places?
In this talk, I will show how breaking the construction of the library website into as-needed, swappable microservices can free your content to live where it needs to, as well as free you from the maintenance headaches usually involved. What kind of microservices, you ask? Well, basic templating and styling is a given, but how about a microservice that gracefully degrades your layouts for older browsers? Or enforces highfalutin typographic rules? Or optimizes your site assets to improve load times? All wonderful little black boxes that allow you to focus on the website and its content, and not the details. I promise at least one diagram. That will burn your eyes. </span></span></dt>

Launched in London in December 2008, Mendeley is already the world’s largest research collaboration platform. Through this platform, we anonymously pools users’ research paper collections, creating a crowd-sourced research database with a unique layer of social information - each research paper is connected with socio-demographic information about its audience.  Based on this platform and data, I will present three examples of how Mendeley is working to support university libraries and contribute to opening up academic research: 1) Mendeley’s integration as a workflow tool with institutional repositories with the aim of increasing IR deposit rates; 2) Application examples building on Mendeley’s API to showcase what is possible with the newly available type of usage data Mendeley is aggregating; 3) Preview of Mendeley’s library dashboard that will reveal content usage within an institution. </span></span></dt>

At Code4Lib 2008 <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2008/scott">Dan Scott gave us a taste</a> of yummy <a href="http://couchdb.org/">CouchDB</a>, a document-oriented database with a RESTful JSON API. Since then, CouchDB has passed the 1.0 mark and landed on desktops, the cloud, and mobile devices. With the advent of CouchApps (web apps served directly from CouchDB) applications can be built that are as easy to install as the replicating of databases (which is super easy!). I'll discuss the advantages and challenges in designing a CouchApp to be used as a catalog, repository, or directory of resources. Some things are made fairly simple, such as site templating, the outputting of documents in different formats, and the attachment of binary objects to documents. Some things, like document versioning and the modeling of data, are a little trickier, but still straightforward. And some things, such as granular authentication and the integration of search, are tangled enough to produce some head-on-wall banging. But hey, take it easy. It’s time to relax.

We have developed a unique cataloging and discovery system using Drupal, which we eventually hope to provide as a standalone module that any organization can implement as both a technical and theoretical template to start an Underground Library in its own city. Chicago Underground Library (CUL) is a replicable model for community collections. It uses the lens of an archive to examine the creative, political, and intellectual interdependencies of a city, tracing how people have worked together, who influenced whom, where ideas first developed, and how they spread from one publication to another through individuals.

Learn how we increased the performance of the XC Metadata Services Toolkit (MST) by over 900%. The MST is an open-source Java application, that uses SOLR and MySQL to harvest (OAI-PMH) library metadata (MARC, DC), clean it up, convert and frbrize, and then make new metadata (RDA flavor, XC Schema) available for harvesting. Our first release performed too slowly with degrading performance with large record batches and we needed to enable the MST to process a library’s entire catalog in a reasonable amount of time on a common server. The MST was also intended to be extensible. Libraries will almost certainly want to customize this process in some way. Thus our second goal was to make it is as easy as possible for a developer to write a service which can be plugged into the MST.

Many of the complications of born-digital records involve preparing them for transfer into a storage or preservation environment. Digital evidence of any kind is easily susceptible to unintentional and intentional modification. This presentation will describe the use of open source forensic software in pre-ingest workflows for digital archives. Digital archivists and other digital curation practitioners can develop emergent processes to prepare records for ingest and transfer using a combination of relatively simple tools. The granularity and simplicity of these tools and procedures provides the possibility for their smooth integration into a digital curation environment built on micro-services.

Using a few tools that you probably already have laying around your library I'll show how OpenLayers can be used to create a dynamic interface for browsing and searching your digital collections geographically. With very little effort Solr can be made to serve up results directly into OpenLayers creating all sorts of mapping possibilities. With a little more effort a Postgres database can handle complex polygon searches. I'll talk about how we're developing a lightweight GIS framework to provide a new user experience for interacting with a number of our collections in unique ways.

Most, if not all, library websites are housed and maintained in singular, monolithic content management systems. This is fantastic if the library website is the one place your users go for library information. But it isn't. Users are going to Facebook, checking mobile applications, browsing portals as well as checking the library website. Wouldn't it be great if you could update the information on all of these sites from a single source? Why maintain the library hours in five different places?

In this talk, I will show how breaking the construction of the library website into as-needed, swappable microservices can free your content to live where it needs to, as well as free you from the maintenance headaches usually involved. What kind of microservices, you ask? Well, basic templating and styling is a given, but how about a microservice that gracefully degrades your layouts for older browsers? Or enforces highfalutin typographic rules? Or optimizes your site assets to improve load times? All wonderful little black boxes that allow you to focus on the website and its content, and not the details. I promise at least one diagram. That will burn your eyes.

<a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> is a technology startup that is helping to revolutionize the way research is done. Used by more than 600,000 academics and industry researchers, Mendeley enables researchers to arrange collaborative projects, work and discuss in groups, as well as share data across its web platform. Launched in London in December 2008, Mendeley is already the world’s largest research collaboration platform. Through this platform, we anonymously pools users’ research paper collections, creating a crowd-sourced research database with a unique layer of social information - each research paper is connected with socio-demographic information about its audience. Based on this platform and data, I will present three examples of how Mendeley is working to support university libraries and contribute to opening up academic research: 1) Mendeley’s integration as a workflow tool with institutional repositories with the aim of increasing IR deposit rates; 2) Application examples building on Mendeley’s API to showcase what is possible with the newly available type of usage data Mendeley is aggregating; 3) Preview of Mendeley’s library dashboard that will reveal content usage within an institution.

<a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/om">Opinionated Metadata</a> (OM) grew from discussions at Code4Lib 2010. It's now an integral component in the <a href="http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/The+Hydra+Framework+and+its+Parts">Hydra Framework</a>. Unlike most XML solutions, which start from schemas and build outwards, OM allows you to start from the natural vocabulary that emerges in user stories. Based on the terms that show up in those user stories, you can use OM to create a Terminology that maps each term to nodes in schema-driven XML. This Terminology then serves as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for your code to rely on.

Evaluating search result relevancy is difficult for any sizable amount of data, since human vetted ideal search results are essentially non-existent. This is true even for library collections, despite dedicated librarians and their familiarity with the collections. So how can we evaluate if search engine configuration changes (e.g. boosting, field analysis, search analysis settings) are an improvement? How can we ensure the results for query A don’t degrade while we try to improve results for query B? Why yes, Virginia, automatable tests are the answer. This talk will show you how you can easily write these tests from your hidden goldmine of human vetted relevancy rankings.

Libraries have historically delivered value to society by facilitating the sharing of books. The library "brand" is built around the building and exploitation of their collections. These collections have been acquired and owned. As ebook readers become the preferred consumption platform for books, libraries are beginning to come to terms with the fact that they don't own their digital collections, and can't share books as they'd like to. Yet libraries continue to be valuable in many ways. In this transitional period, only one thing can save libraries from irrelevance and dissipation: Code.

We have recently rearchitected our homegrown digital library utilizing an all-XML framework. The system is comprised of a data repository residing in a native XML database (eXist-DB), a metadata editor constructed using a Java-based XForms processor (Orbeon Forms), and a series of services for image manipulation, OCR processing and OAI-PMH serving. In this talk, I will detail our workflow process from scanning to online publishing, demonstrate the software's flexible configuration and features, and how these steps allow rapid digital preservation and online access. Oh, and it's open source, so I'll show you where to get it as well.

Mark Jason Dominus has a nice page <a href="http://perl.plover.com/lt/lightning-talks.html">about lightning talk</a>s, which includes this summary of why you might want to do one:

<em>Maybe you've never given a talk before, and you'd like to start small. For a Lightning Talk, you don't need to make slides, and if you do decide to make slides, you only need to make three.

Maybe you're nervous and you're afraid you'll mess up. It's a lot easier to plan and deliver a five minute talk than it is to deliver a long talk. And if you do mess up, at least the painful part will be over quickly.

Maybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a question, or invite people to help you with your project, or boast about something you did, or tell a short cautionary story. These things are all interesting and worth talking about, but there might not be enough to say about them to fill up thirty minutes.</em>

Five years ago, I discovered that the <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal CMS</a> had a programming framework disguised as an API, and learned that I could use it to solve problems.

Drupal 7 builds on that to provide a powerful toolset for interfacing with, manipulating and presenting data. It empowers tool-builders by providing a minimal install option, along with a more powerful installation profile system makes it easier for developers to package and distribute their applications.

The University of Illinois Libraries launched a mobile interface in Spring 2010 that includes a custom mobile catalog layer built on top of <a href="http://vufind.org/">VuFind</a>. It allows patrons to request books for delivery, to browse the local and CARLI consortium catalogs, and access account information for renewal & checking hold status. This presentation will focus on new features designed to add value for the mobile user, such as adding Google map links to catalog records, offering current information for campus bus stops, and automatic device detection for users accessing the full-sized library gateway from their mobile device. I’ll discuss how developing for the mobile context, and talking to mobile users, has informed the further development & improvement of library web services overall.

<a href="/conference/2011/schedule">Code4Lib 2011</a>, Tuesday 8 February, 11:30 - 11:50

Libraries are notorious for maintaining data in massively disparate systems such as databases, flat files, xml and web services. The data is rich and valuable to assessment, but extracting value from multiple systems is complex and time consuming. Yes, there are open source and commercial solutions available, but libraries have unique requirements that can be difficult to integrate into these products. Commercial options also tend to be overly complex or the cool features require an expensive enterprise edition.

With funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, UPenn is developing MetriDoc to address data integration headaches within the library, and support reporting requirements from management. MetriDoc’s mission is to provide an open source API / tool set where users can specify dataflows and use library based services to solve integration problems while MetriDoc worries about scalability and performance. MetriDoc accomplishes this with no complex xml configuration or scary SOA middleware, but instead uses a simple DSL where possible. Eventually the project will also include dashboards to assist with complex job management and data flow monitoring.

The first half the presentation briefly discusses MetriDoc’s architecture while the remainder of the presentation will include code samples to illustrate problems it can solve. Information on how to contribute or download MetriDoc will be provided as well.

It’s well-established that <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" title="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" rel="nofollow">Solr</a> provides an excellent foundation for building a faceted search engine. But what if your application’s foundation has already been constructed? How do you add Solr as a federated, fulltext search component to an existing system that already provides a full set of well-crafted scoring and ranking mechanisms?

This talk will describe a work-in-progress project at the <a href="http://adswww.harvard.edu/" title="http://adswww.harvard.edu/" rel="nofollow">Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System</a> to migrate its aging search platform to <a href="http://invenio-software.org/" title="http://invenio-software.org/" rel="nofollow">Invenio</a>, an open-source institutional repository and digital library system originally developed at CERN, while at the same time incorporating Solr as an external component for both faceting and fulltext search.

In this presentation we'll start with a short introduction of Invenio and then move on to the good stuff: an in-depth exploration of our use of Solr. We'll explain the challenges that we faced, what we learned about some particular Solr internals, interesting paths we chose not to follow, and the solutions we finally developed, including the creation of custom Solr request handlers and query parser classes.

This presentation will be quite technical and will show a measure of horrible Java code. Benoit will probably run away during that part.

<a href="/conference/2011/schedule">Code4Lib 2011</a>, Tuesday 8 February, 13:50 - 14:10

In summer 2010, the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/">Center for History and New Media</a> at George Mason University, supported by an NEH Summer Institute grant, gathered 12 'digital humanists' for an intense week of collaboration they dubbed 'One Week | One Tool: a digital humanities barn raising.' The group -- several of whom hang their professional hats in libraries and most of whom were previously unacquainted -- was asked to spend one week together brainstorming, specifying, building, publicizing, and releasing an open source software tool of use to the digital humanities community. The result was Anthologize, a free, open source plugin that transforms WordPress into a platform for publishing electronic texts in formats including PDF, ePub, and TEI; in other words, a "blog-to-book" tool. This presentation will focus on how One Week | One Tool addressed the challenges of collaborative open source development. From the perspectives of two library coders on the team, we will describe and provide lessons learned from the One Week development process including: how the group structured itself without predefined roles; how the one week time frame and makeup of the group -- which included scholars, grad students, librarians, museum professionals, instructional technologists, and more -- influenced planning and development decisions; the roles of user experience and outreach efforts; the life of Anthologize since the end of the week; and thoughts on what a one week, one 'library' tool could look like.

The <a href="http://vufind.org/">VuFind</a> discovery layer has been providing a user-friendly interface to MARC records for several years now. However, library data consists of more than just MARC records, and VuFind has grown to accommodate just about anything you can throw at it. This presentation will examine the new workflows and tools that enable discovery of non-MARC resources and some of the non-traditional applications of VuFind that they make possible. Technologies covered will include OAI-PMH, XSLT, Aperture, Solr and, of course, VuFind itself.

title: So you want to start a Kindle lending program
created: 1323903061
---
<p><strong>Update:</strong> With the introduction of Whispercast, the ability to register a device from the Amazon website using a serial number has been removed.  It pretty much takes the best part of the following process and throws it in the trash.  Bummer.</p>

<p><em>This article is about Kindle ebook readers.  The actual hardware Kindles and not the iOS app, Android app, web reader, or Kindle Fire.  Just the good old Kindle hardware reader.  Yes, I understand there are countless ebook reader platforms and DRM free ebook collections to choose from, but if you&#8217;ve read past the title you probably understand that I&#8217;m going to focus on Kindles and content purchased from Amazon.  I appreciate your understanding.</em></p>

<p>Lending out Kindles to patrons may, on the surface, seem like a really easy thing to do and undoubtedly there is a lot of excitement with regards to using &#8220;technology&#8221; in the library.  Perhaps it&#8217;s easier to get funding for a project if you sprinkle in a little technology.  I&#8217;m not here to stomp your newfound excitement into the ground, but I do want to help you understand the technical issues that you will need to deal with to make this program workable and sustainable.  It should be noted that Kindles are designed to be personal devices and we&#8217;re using them for institutional purposes.  We are bending them about as far as they can bend without breaking.  </p>

<p>The issues around how to circulate your Kindles is beyond the scope of this article, although I will do my best to describe how our system works.  I would strongly advise that you work with your circulation folks to figure out what will work best for them with regard to these devices.</p>

<h2 id="where_to_start">Where To Start</h2>

<p>We start at the beginning, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200506200">Kindle License Agreement and Terms of Use</a>.  Some very specific things that you need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Digital Content is licensed, not sold, to you by the Content Provider.&#8221;</strong> <br />
I&#8217;m sure this isn&#8217;t news to most of you, but it&#8217;s an important thing to know.  Kindle books are not like books in stacks.  Yes, they are both made of words, but that&#8217;s pretty much where the similarities end &#8212; for better or worse.</li>
<li><strong>&#8220;&#8230;you may not bypass, modify, defeat, or circumvent security features that protect the Digital Content.&#8221;</strong> <br />
That&#8217;s right, we&#8217;re talking about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">DMCA</a>.  So, don&#8217;t try and root your Kindle or strip the DRM off those ebooks.</li>
<li><strong>&#8220;In order to keep your Software up-to-date, Amazon may automatically provide your Kindle or Other Device with updates/upgrades to the Software.&#8221;</strong> <br />
Unless of course you keep them completely off the network, which also renders them somewhat less functional.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another very important piece of information is tucked away at the bottom of this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_kip_faq_num?nodeId=200298470&amp;#howmany">Kindle Help</a> page, which is that you can use up to 6 Kindle devices to access the ebooks purchased from a single Amazon account.  Basically that means you will need a separate Amazon account for every six Kindles.  That also means that if you want an ebook on, say, 12 Kindles, you would need to purchase the ebook in both accounts.  But, you&#8217;re thinking big.  You want to buy <strong>one-hundred</strong> Kindles.</p>

<p><strong>100/6 = 17 accounts</strong> (you can&#8217;t have 16.6 accounts, you have to round up)</p>

<p>But no matter how many Kindles you plan on buying, you will want to keep some critical pieces of information about each device in a place that is accessible by the people who will manage them.  You will want to keep a list/spreadsheet/database current with the name (Kindle 1, etc.), serial number, and MAC address.  The MAC address will be handy if your organization has the ability to whitelist devices for Wi-Fi access.</p>

<h2 id="the_good_old_days_of_managing_a_kindle_collection">The Good Old Days Of Managing A Kindle Collection</h2>

<p>So, you have your 6 or 100 Kindles and you&#8217;re ready to start buying books.  How do you get from buying books on amazon.com to having them on all your Kindles?  Well, that <em>used</em> to be a lot easier.  I realize that it&#8217;s a bit mean of me to tell you how good things used to be and that you can&#8217;t have those nice things, but I think highlighting how frustrating DRM is for customers is important.  Feel free to skip ahead a bit, I won&#8217;t; think less of you.  It turns out that prior to Kindle firmware 3.3 you could take Kindle books off a Kindle device and load them onto other devices and it would &#8220;just work.&#8221;  Yes, even content purchased from different Amazon accounts.  It was the best thing ever in terms of dealing with purchased content for your Kindles.  You could use software, such as Calibre, to manage a central collection of ebooks.  The easy way to get a Kindle ready for check-out was to reset to factory defaults and then use Calibre to copy your collection to the Kindle via the USB cable.  From blank slate to full of ebooks in 5 minutes.  You could do this without even registering the Kindle!  It was truly a glorious way to deal with Kindles.</p>

<p>But then 3.3 hit and now each ebook is tied to a specific device, most likely by the serial number required when you register the device.  There is no (safe) way to downgrade your Kindle, and even if you could as soon as it got on a Wi-Fi network, it would upgrade itself.  The days of having a centralized Kindle library are over.</p>

<h2 id="the_new_reality_of_managing_a_kindle_collection">The New Reality Of Managing A Kindle Collection</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re managing Kindles you simply have to maintain a library (essentially a backup of the books on the device that you store on your computer) for each Kindle.  Luckily there is <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>, which has very nice support for Kindles and maintaining multiple libraries.  Calibre is like an open source iTunes for ebooks.  It can manage all your files and synchronize them with devices like the Kindle.  If you are going to have multiple people managing Kindles, make sure you create your Calibre libraries on a file server that these folks all have access to from their desktops.  </p>

<p>The easiest way to seed each library is to register the Kindle and download all your ebooks from the Kindle <em>Archived Items</em>.  The Kindle <em>Archived Items</em> is where you can retrieve purchased books from Amazon that are not currently on the device, assuming that the device is registered with the purchasing account of course.  You&#8217;ll see <em>Archived Items</em> listed on the main screen when the device is registered with an account.  The end game is that you have downloaded all the books to the device so that we can back them all up using Calibre.  Yes, this is tedious and annoying, but it only has to be done once.  That is, until we get to buying new content.</p>

<p>To back up the books after they have all been downloaded, open Calibre and create a new library on your network share, preferably named after the Kindle you are using (we use &#8216;Kindle 1&#8217; though &#8216;Kindle 6&#8217;).  Once all your ebooks are on the device, plug your Kindle in via USB and use Calibre to transfer all the books to the library for that Kindle.  You now have a &#8220;pristine&#8221; library <em>for that particular Kindle</em>.  Thanks to the DRM on the ebooks you will need to repeat this for <strong>every</strong> Kindle.</p>

<p>After you have a library for a Kindle, you can deregister the device and reset it to factory defaults.</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Kindle Home screen, hit Menu and select Settings.</li>
<li>Once in Settings, hit Menu again and select &#8220;Reset to Factory Defaults.&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can restore content from the library without having to register the device (the DRM seems to be tied to the serial number).</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch the Calibre software and select the proper library for the Kindle you&#8217;re working with.</li>
<li>Connect Kindle to the PC via the USB cable, wait until the Kindle displays that it is in USB Drive Mode and the Kindle Device icon appears on the Calibre toolbar.</li>
<li>Click the Library icon in the toolbar and then select all the ebooks in Calibre library.</li>
<li>Send all Kindle ebooks the device by clicking the Send to Device icon.</li>
<li>From the Device icon, select Eject Device.</li>
</ol>

<p>The advantages to this model is that you can have almost anyone manage a Kindle without them having to know anything about the account that was used to purchase the content.  Care must be taken to make sure that you sync the right library with the right Kindle, otherwise, the content will be unreadable.</p>

<h2 id="adding_content_to_your_kindle_libraries">Adding Content To Your Kindle Libraries</h2>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve made &#8220;pristine&#8221; copies of each Kindle, what happens when you buy a book?  Well, this part will be a bit of work as well.  As you know, the Kindle DRM is now more strictly enforced, so a copy will need to be procured for each device.  You can do this from the Kindle itself, but it will need to be registered first (once registered purchased ebooks will appear in <em>Archived Items</em>) and that can be rather time consuming, especially depending on how many Kindles you have.  After you download the ebook to the Kindle you will want to transfer that ebook into the Calibre library for that Kindle.  You can also download Kindle files from the Amazon web site and place those in the Calibre library, but you must do that for <em>each</em> device.  When you register a device on the Amazon web site (aren&#8217;t you glad you have that list of serial numbers?), the device itself will be registered, assuming that it has network access.  At that point, the device could make purchases on the account.  Conversely, when you register the device from the Kindle, it will show up in your list of devices on the Amazon web site.</p>

<p>This can make getting copies of an ebook into your Calibre libraries (a unique copy of every ebook for every Kindle, it&#8217;s the DRM way) tricky, especially if you&#8217;re registering a Kindle that it is currently checked out by a patron.  If the patron has registered the Kindle under their own account and then you try to register the device on the Amazon web site, you will receive an error message stating that the Kindle cannot be registered.  This is probably a good thing in terms of the patron experience.</p>

<h2 id="the_reality_of_kindles">The Reality of Kindles</h2>

<p>Previously I said that Kindles were personal devices.  What did I mean by that?  Kindles are designed to be owned by a single person with an Amazon account.  They are not loaned out to &#8220;friends&#8221; (or in our case, patrons).  You don&#8217;t worry about somebody else using your Kindle because, well, it&#8217;s <em>yours</em>.  Why would somebody else even have it in the first place?  The only &#8220;control&#8221; you can place on access to the device is a simple password.  Once you are past that, access is unfettered, and by &#8220;unfettered&#8221; I mean that 1-Click™ purchasing is now available.  Again, the device isn&#8217;t designed to be used for institutional purposes.  In fact, it&#8217;s not even designed to be used for familial purposes.  Many people are used to, or at least familiar with, the idea that any device can have certain features disabled unless a passcode is provided.  Remember when the <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/vchip/">V-Chip</a> was a thing?  Yeah, neither does anyone else, but parental controls are something that are expected of major operating systems.  Mac OS, iOS, and Windows all have features that allow the device to be crippled for users who don&#8217;t know that magic incantation to unlock all the levels.  The Kindle has none of this.  You can&#8217;t restrict network access.  You can&#8217;t restrict purchases.  In fact, here is the text from the Amazon site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"All Kindle transactions are completed with 1-Click. Changes made to your default 1-Click method will apply to future Amazon.com 1-Click transactions, but will not change your current active subscriptions."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why Kindles <em>must</em> be unregistered before they are sent out the door.  Well, unless you have an unlimited budget, of course.  At the beginning I mentioned that the Kindle Fire was excluded from this discussion.  Why?  Well, it turns out that a Fire is pretty much useless unless it&#8217;s registered with an Amazon account, and yes, the lack of &#8220;parental controls&#8221; extends to the Fire.</p>

<h2 id="circulating_your_kindles">Circulating Your Kindles</h2>

<p>Again, I can&#8217;t stress enough that you will want to work closely with the folks that run circulation to make sure you come up with a workable plan.  I will ignore the details of our catalog, which will undoubtedly differ from yours in more ways than they are similar.  Our system is fairly basic: the patron either places a hold on a Kindle from the web interface of the catalog or can request a Kindle from our main circulation desk.  The Kindles have bar codes on the front, along with a name tag for easy visual identification.  The Kindles all have cases that hold the charger cord and two laminated cards, one with the &#8220;rules&#8221; and the other with a quick &#8220;cheat sheet&#8221; for navigating the Kindle.  Kindles must be checked in at the main circulation desk to a real person.  There is a replacement fee for returning a Kindle in a non-working condition (actually broken, not just a dead battery).</p>

<h2 id="in_summary">In Summary</h2>

<p>There is a lot to managing a small number of Kindles and thanks to DRM the process does not scale well.  The start up costs, in terms of creating the initial libraries, are somewhat high and the on-going maintenance of keeping the libraries up to date as you purchase more ebooks is certainly non-trivial.  That being said, it <em>can</em> be done.  So, depending on how badly you need to be able to lend Kindles, you may want to rethink your plans.  There are certainly scenarios where the work involved would be justified by the benefit to the patron or perhaps in cost savings.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or complaints please feel free to contact me.</p>

title: Discussion for Elsevier App Challenge during Code4Lib 2012
created: 1325186817
---
Hello Everyone,

My name is Nishit Bhuva and I am the Partner Development Manager in the Developer Network team at Elsevier. I am sure many of the Code4Lib members must be aware of SciVerse Applications that are developed on the Elsevier platform. For the members who are new to this platform, the apps on SciVerse basically assist researchers in accelerating their scientific study by saving time and effort and presenting targeted information, rather than having them go through the vast amount of scientific data available.

We are very excited about the Code4Lib conference. Elsevier was one of the sponsors for Code4Lib 2011 and we are also on the sponsors list for Code4Lib 2012. Since SciVerse apps are excellent tools that bring precise scientific information at the fingertips of researchers, we are interested in engaging with all members of Code4Lib to use their expertise and assist the scientific community in accelerating their research. To facilitate the engagement with Code4Lib members, we are interested in organizing an App Challenge prior to and during the 2012 conference. This challenge will give Code4Lib members an opportunity to showcase their talents on a global platform. <!--break-->Below is a draft outline for the challenge we are interested in organizing (this draft is open for discussion).

Stage 1: Submit your concepts/ideas for an app.

•	Concept/Idea submission begins on January 9, 2012.
•	Deadline for submission will be January 31, 2012.
•	Submissions should include a detailed concept/idea description and poster/slides showing functionality of the app.
•	Top 10-15 concepts/ideas will be selected by Elsevier.
•	Entries could be as individuals/teams.

Stage 2: Build an app based on selected concepts.

•	The poster/slides of selected entries will be displayed on all days of the conference.
•	Members of the winning teams will build apps during the 4 days of the conference (February 6 – 9, 2012).
•	End deliverable will be a working prototype of the app.
•	Three winners will be selected by Elsevier 
•	Winners receive cash rewards after the conference.
•	Entries could be as individuals/teams.

Some of you might be wondering that what happens to concept/ideas and prototype apps that are not selected. The good news is, these go to the SciVerse Labs Applications gallery where:
•	The concepts can be used by any developer to build apps and,
•	Original developers of app prototypes will have an opportunity to continue their work.

I would be glad to hear from all members about their thoughts on this challenge and also discuss other possibilities to engage during the conference.

Happy Holidays to all !

Best,
Nishit

title: ALL TEH METADATAS! or How we use RDF to keep all of the digital object metadata
  formats thrown at us - Declan Fleming
created: 1327338506

<strong>ALL TEH METADATAS! or How we use RDF to keep all of the digital object metadata formats thrown at us</strong>
<ul>
<li>Declan Fleming, University of California, San Diego, dfleming AT ucsd DING edu</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/conference/2012/">code4lib 2012</a>, Tuesday 7 February 2012, 11:40-12:00</p>
<p>
What's the right metadata standard to use for a digital repository? There isn't just one standard that fits documents, videos, newspapers, audio files, local data, etc. And there is no standard to rule them all. So what do you do? At UC San Diego Libraries, we went down a conceptual level and attempted to hold every piece of metadata and give each holding place some context, hopefully in a common namespace. RDF has proven to be the ideal solution, and allows us to work with MODS, PREMIS, MIX, and just about anything else we've tried. It also opens up the potential for data re-use and authority control as other metadata owners start thinking about and expressing their data in the same way. I'll talk about our workflow which takes metadata from a stew of various sources (CSV dumps, spreadsheet data of varying richness, MARC data, and MODS data), normalizes them into METS by our Metadata Specialists who create an assembly plan, and then ingests them into our digital asset management system. The result is a <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6923768/Work/DAMS%20object%20rdf%20graph.png">beautiful graph</a> of RDF triples with metadata poised to be expressed as <a href="https://libraries.ucsd.edu/digital/">HTML</a>, RSS, METS, XML, and opens linked data possibilities that we are just starting to explore.

<p>
Within a relatively short time since their introduction, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Version_Control_System">distributed version control systems</a> (DVCS) like <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> have enjoyed widespread adoption for versioning code. It didn’t take long for the library development community to start discussing the potential for using DVCS within our applications and repositories to version data. After all, many of the features that have made some of these systems popular in the open source community to version code (e.g. lightweight, file-based, compressed, reliable) also make them compelling options for versioning data. And why write an entire versioning system from scratch if a DVCS solution can be a drop-in solution? At the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/">California Digital Library</a> (CDL) we’ve started using Git and Mercurial in some of our applications to version data. This has proven effective in some situations and unworkable in others. This presentation will be a practical case study of CDL’s experiences with using DVCS to version data. We will explain how we’re incorporating Git and Mercurial in our applications, describe our successes and failures and consider the issues involved in repurposing these systems for data versioning.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.hathitrust.org/">HathiTrust Large-Scale search</a> provides full-text search services over nearly 10 million full-text books using Solr for the back-end. Our index is around 5-6 TB in size and each shard contains over 3 billion unique terms due to content in over 400 languages and dirty OCR.
</p>
<p>
Searching the full-text of 10 million books often results in very large result sets. By conference time a number of <a href="http://www.hathitrust.org/full-text-search-features-and-analysis">features</a> designed to help users narrow down large result sets and to do exploratory searching will either be in production or in preparation for release. There are often trade-offs between implementing desirable user features and keeping response time reasonable in addition to the traditional search trade-offs of precision versus recall.
</p>
<p>
We will discuss various <a href="http://www.hathitrust.org/blogs/large-scale-search">scalability</a> and usability issues including:
<ul>
<li>Trade-offs between desirable user features and keeping response time reasonable and scalable</li>
<li>Our solution to providing the ability to search within the 10 million books and also search within each book</li>
<li>Migrating the <a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb">personal collection builder application</a> from a separate Solr instance to an app which uses the same back-end as full-text search.</li>
<li>Design of a scalable multilingual spelling suggester</li>

<p>
Linked data is poised to replace MARC as the basis for the new library bibliographic framework. For libraries to benefit from linked data, they must learn about it, experiment with it, demonstrate its usefulness, and take a leadership role in its deployment.
The eXtensible Catalog Organization (XCO) offers open-source software for libraries that is “linked-data-ready.” XC software prepares MARC and Dublin Core metadata for exposure to the semantic web, incorporating FRBR Group 1 entities and registered vocabularies for RDA elements and roles. This presentation will include a software demonstration, proposed software architecture for creation and management of linked data, a vision for how libraries can migrate from MARC to linked data, and an update on XCO progress toward linked data goals.

<em>"The code itself is unimportant; a project is only as useful as people actually find it." - Linus Torvalds</em> <a href="http://bit.ly/p4uuyy">[1]</a>
</p>
<p>
Usability has been a buzzword for some time now, but what is the process for making the the transition toward a better user experience, and hence, better designed library sites? I will discuss the one facet of the process my team is using to redesign the Finding Aids site for Princeton University Libraries (still in development). The approach involves the use of rapid prototyping, with Bootstrap <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">[2]</a>, to make sure we are on track with what users and stakeholders expect up front, and throughout the development process.
</p>
<p>
Because Bootstrap allows for early and iterative user feedback, it is more effective than the historic Photoshop mockups/wireframe technique. The Photoshop approach allows stakeholders to test the look, but not the feel -- and often leaves developers scratching their heads. Being a CSS/HTML/Javascript grid-based framework, Bootstrap makes it easy for anyone with a bit of HTML/CSS chops to quickly build slick, interactive prototypes right in the browser -- tangible solutions which can be shared, evaluated, revised, and followed by all stakeholders (see Minimum Viable Products <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">[3]</a>). Efficiency is multiplied because the customized prototypes can flow directly into production use, as is the goal with iterative development approaches, such as the Agile methodology.
</p>
<p>
While Bootstrap is not the only framework that offers grid-based layout, development is expedited and usability is enhanced by Bootstraps use of of "prefabbed" conventional UI patterns, clean typography, and lean Javascript for interactivity. Furthermore, out-of-the box Bootstrap comes in a fairly neutral palette, so focus remains on usability, and does not devolve into premature discussions of color or branding choices. Finally, using Less can be a powerful tool in conjunction with Bootstrap, but is not necessary. I will discuss the pros and cons, and offer examples for how to getting up and running with or without Less.

<p>
The Grateful Dead Archive at the University of California (Santa Cruz) is a collection of over 600 linear feet of material, including: business records, photographs, posters, fan envelopes, tickets, video, audio (oral histories, interviews and music) and 3-d objects such as stage props and band merchandise. In addition, with the release of the Grateful Dead Archive Online website in 2012, the Archive will start actively collecting artifacts from an enthusiastic community of Grateful Dead fans.
</p>
<p>
This talk will discuss the challenges of merging a traditional archive with a socially constructed one. We will also present the first round of development and explain how we're using tools like Omeka, ContentDM, UC3 Merritt, djatoka, Kaltura, Google Maps, and Solr to lay the foundation for a robust and engaging site. Future directions, like the integration/development of better curation tools and what we hope to learn from opening the archive to contributions from a large community of fans, will also be discussed.

<p>
Linked Library Data activity over the last year has seen bibliographic data sets and vocabularies proliferating from traditional library sources. We've reached a point where regular libraries don't have to go it alone to be on the Semantic Web. There is a quickly growing pool of things we can actually link to, and everyone's existing data can be immediately enriched by participating.
This is a quick and dirty road to getting your catalog onto the Linked Data web. The talk will take you from start to finish, using Free Software tools to establish a namespace, put up a SPARQL endpoint, make a simple data model, convert MARC records to RDF, and link the results to major existing data sets (skipping conveniently over pesky processing time). A small amount of "why linked data?" content will be covered, but the primary goal is to leave you able to reproduce the process and start linking your catalog into the web of data. Appropriate documentation will be on the web.

UI development is hard and too often ends up as an after-thought to computer programmers - if you were a CS major in college I'll bet you didn't have many, if any, design courses. I'll talk about how to involve the users upfront with design and some common pitfalls of this approach. I'll also make a case for why you should do the screen design before a single line of code is written. And I'll throw in some ideas for increasing usability and attractiveness of your web applications. I'd like to make a case study of the UI development of our open source ERMS.

<p><a href="/conference/2012">code4lib 2012</a>, Wednesday, February 8 2012, 09:55-10:15</p>
<p>
This is partly a tool talk and partly a big idea one.
</p>
<p>
Mendeley has built the world's largest open database of research and we've now begun to collect some interesting social metadata around the document metadata. I would like to share with the Code4Lib attendees information about using this resource to do things within your application that have previously been impossible for the library community, or in some cases impossible without expensive database subscriptions. One thing that's now possible is to augment catalog search by surfacing information about content usage, allowing people to not only find things matching a query, but popular things or things read by their colleagues. In addition to augmenting search, you can also use this information to augment discovery. Imagine an online exhibit of artifacts from a newly discovered dig not just linking to papers which discuss the artifact, but linking to really good interesting papers about the place and the people who made the artifacts. So the big idea is, "How will looking at the literature from a broader perspective than simple citation analysis change how research is done and communicated? How can we build tools that make this process easier and faster?" I can show some examples of applications that have been built using the Mendeley and PLoS APIs to begin to address this question, and I can also present results from Mendeley's developer challenge which shows what kinds of applications researchers are looking for, what kind of applications peope are building, and illustrates some interesting places where the two don't overlap.

<p><a href="/conference/2012">code4lib 2012</a>, Wednesday, February 8 2012, 09:15-09:35</p>
<p>
Digital library administrators are frequently asked questions like "How many times was that document downloaded", or "What’s the most popular book in our collection?" Conventional web logging software, such as AWStats, can only answer those questions some of the time, and there’s always the question of whether or not the data is polluted by non-users, such as spiders and crawlers. Google Analytics, (<a href="http://google.com/analytics/">http://google.com/analytics/</a>) , a JavaScript-based solution that excludes most crawlers and bots, shows how users found your site and how they explored it.
</p>
<p>
The presentation will review tracking search queries, adding events such as clicking external links or downloading files, and custom variables, to track user behavior that is normally difficult to track. We'll also discuss using jQuery scripts to add tracking code to the page without having to modify the underlying web application. Once you've collected data, you may use the Google Analytics API to extract data and integrate it with data from your digital repository to show granular data about individual items in your Digital Library. Finally, we'll discuss how this information allows you to improve the user experience, and summarize some of the research we are doing with our digital repository and the data gathered from Google Analytics.

<p>
Searching the library is complex. There's the catalog, article databases, journal title and database title look-ups, the library website, finding aids, knowledge bases, etc. How would users search if they could get to all of these resources from a single search box? I'll share what we've learned about single search at NCSU Libraries by tracking use of QuickSearch (<a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/search/index.php?q=aerospace+engineering">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/search/index.php?q=aerospace+engineering</a>), our home-grown unified search application. As part of this talk I will suggest low-cost ways to collect real world use data that can be applied to improve search. I will try to convince you that data collection must be carefully planned and designed to be an effective tool to help you understand what your users are telling you through their behavior. I will talk about how the fragmented library resource environment challenges us to provide useful and understandable search environments. Finally, I will share findings from analyzing millions of user transactions about how people search the library from a production single search box at a large university library.

When it comes to storing data in web browsers on a semi-persistent basis, there are several partially-adopted, semi-deprecated, product-specific, or even universally accepted options. These include models such as key-value stores, relational databases, and object stores. I will present some of these options and discuss possible applications of these technologies in library services. In addition to quoting heavily from Mark Pilgrim's excellent chapter on this topic, I will weave in my own experience utilizing in-browser data storage in an iPad-based data collection tool to successfully improve performance and data stability while reducing network dependence.

We've all heard about that one study that showed that Pair Programming was 20% efficient than working alone. Or maybe you saw on a blog that study that showed that programmers who write fewer lines of code per day are more efficient...or was it less efficient? And of course, we all know that programmers who work in (Ruby|Python|Java|C|Erlang) have been shown to be more efficient.

<p><a href="/conference/2012">code4lib 2012</a>, Wednesday, February 8 2012, 10:55-11:15</p>
<p>
In October, the Library of Congress issued a news release, "A Bibliographic Framework for the Digital Age" outlining a list of requirements for a New Bibliographic Framework Environment. Responding to this challenge, this talk will demonstrate a Redis (<a href="http://redis.io">http://redis.io</a>) FRBR datastore proof-of-concept that, with a lightweight python-based interface, can meet these requirements.
</p>
<p>
Because FRBR is an Entity-Relationship model; it is easily implemented as key-value within the primitive data structures provided by Redis. Redis' flexibility makes it easy to associate arbitrary metadata and vocabularies, like MARC, METS, VRA or MODS, with FRBR entities and inter-operate with legacy and emerging standards and practices like RDA Vocabularies and LinkedData.

Agile development techniques can be difficult to adopt in the context of library software development. Maybe your shop has only one or two developers, or you always have too many simultaneous projects. Maybe your new projects can’t be started until 27 librarians reach consensus on the specifications.
</p>
<p>
This talk will present successful Agile- and Silicon-Valley-inspired practices we’ve adopted at Stanford and/or in the Blacklight and Hydra projects. We’ve targeted developer happiness as well as improved productivity with our recent changes. User stories, dead week, sight lines … it’ll be a grab bag of goodies to bring back to your institution, including some ideas on how to adopt these practices without overt management buy in.

<strong>Search Engine Relevancy Tuning - A Static Rank Framework for Solr/Lucene</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mike Schultz, formerly Summon Search Architect, mike.schultz@gmail.com</li>
</ul
<p><a href="/conference/2012">code4lib 2012</a>, Thursday, February 9 2012, 11:40-12:00</p>
<p>
Solr/Lucene provides a lot of flexibility for adjusting relevancy scoring and improving search results. Roughly speaking there are two areas of concern: Firstly, a 'dynamic rank' calculation that is a function of the user query and document text fields. And secondly, a 'static rank' which is independent of the query and generally is a function of non-text document metadata. In this talk I will outline an easily understood, hand-tunable static rank system with a minimal number of parameters.
</p>
<p>
The obvious major feature of a search engine is to return results relevant to a user query. Perhaps less obvious is the huge role query independent document features play in achieving that. Google's PageRank is an example of a static ranking of web pages based on links and other secret sauce. In the Summon service, our 800 million documents have features like publication date, document type, citation count and Boolean features like the-article-is-peer-reviewed. These fields aren't textual and remain 'static' from query to query, but need to influence a document's relevancy score. In our search results, with all query related features being equal, we'd rather have more recent documents above older ones, Journals above Newspapers, and articles that are peer reviewed above those that are not. The static rank system I will describe achieves this and has the following features:
<ul>
<li>Query-time only calculation - nothing is baked into the index - with parameters adjustable at query time</li>
<li>The system is based on a signal metaphor where components are 'wired' together. System components allow multiplexing, amplifying, summing, tunable band-pass filtering, string-to-value-mapping all with a bare minimum of parameters.</li>
<li>An intuitive approach for mixing dynamic and static rank that is more effective than simple adding or multiplying.</li>
<li>A way of equating disparate static metadata types that leads to understandable results ordering.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Stack View: A Library Browsing Tool</strong>
<ul>
<li>Annie Cain, Harvard Library Innovation Lab, acain@law.harvard.edu</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/conference/2012">code4lib 2012</a>, Wednesday, February 8 2012, 10:35-10:55</p>
<p>
In an effort to recreate and build upon the traditional method of browsing a physical library, we used catalog data, including dimensions and page count, to create a <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/projects/stackview/">virtual shelf</a>.
</p>
<p>
This CSS and JavaScript backed visualization allows items to sit on any number of different shelves, really taking advantage of its digital nature. See how we built Stack View on top of our data and learn how you can create shelves of your own using our open source code.

<p>
Web based library search engines are traditionally operated using keys, input fields, buttons, and links. Being equipped with touch screens, accelerometers, GPS's, and cameras, smartphones and tablets offer a whole new range of input options.
In this talk we'll demonstrate some of our ideas of how to utilise these new input options interacting with a search engine. The basic idea is to have no traditional GUI input elements, but only use touch interactions (pinch, zoom, swipe, long-press, etc) and gestures (shake, tilt, turn, etc.). Using these interactions, we’ll demonstrate how to:
<ul>
<li>do searches</li>
<li>toggle search result views</li>
<li>switch pages</li>
<li>request materials, add to favourites</li>
<li>interact with your stuff, renew items</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>We'll also show you some (conceptual) ideas about using the device camera for locating and checking out materials.</p>
<p>
On a general level, what we are trying to achieve is a move away from a web based paradigm and establish new ways of interaction better suited to the new devices and on their own terms. The demonstration will feature working mobile prototypes including both native apps (iPhone) and web apps. In both cases they will run on live data from our OPAC on <a href="http://www.statsbiblioteket.dk/search/">www.statsbiblioteket.dk/search/</a>
</p>
<p>
This talk is actually also a continuation of our Code4Lib 2010 talk called "Kill The Search Button" (<a href="/conference/2010/schedule">http://code4lib.org/conference/2010/schedule</a>), which we unfortunately never got around to do, due to a Danish blizzard.

<strong>Relevance Ranking in the Scholarly Domain</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tamar Sadeh, PhD, Ex Libris Group, tamar.sadeh@exlibrisgroup.com</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/conference/2012">code4lib 2012</a>, Tuesday 7 February 2012, 13:20-13:40</p> 
<p>
The greatest challenge for discovery systems is how to provide users with the most relevant search results, given the immense landscape of available content. In a manner that is similar to human interaction between two parties, in which each person adjusts to the other in tone, language, and subject matter, discovery systems would ideally be sophisticated and flexible enough to adjust their algorithms to individual users and each user’s information needs.
</p>
<p>
When evaluating the relevance of an item to a specific user in a specific context, relevance-ranking algorithms need to take into account, in addition to the degree to which the item matches the query, information that is not embodied in the item itself. Such information, which includes the item’s scholarly value, the type of search that the user is conducting (e.g., an exploratory search or a known-item search), and other factors, enables a discovery system to fulfill user expectations that have been shaped by experience with Web search engines.
</p>
<p>
The session will focus on the challenges of developing and evaluating relevance-ranking algorithms for the scholarly domain. Examples will be drawn mainly from the relevance-ranking technology deployed by the Ex Libris Primo discovery solution.

<strong>Ask Anything!</strong>

<p><a href="/conference/2012">code4lib 2012</a>, Wednesday, February 8 2012, 11:15-12:00</p>

a.k.a. "Human Search Engine". A chance for you to ask a roomful of code4libbers anything that's on your mind: questions seeking answers (short or long), requests for things (hardware, software, skills, or help), or offers of things. We'll keep the pace fast, and the answers faster. Come with questions and line up at the start of the session and we'll go through as many as we can; sometimes we'll stop at finding the right person or people to answer a query and it'll be up to you to find each other after the session. Third time at code4libcon! (Thanks to Ka-Ping Yee and Dan Chudnov for the inspiration/explanation, reused here in part.)

title: 'Code4Lib Journal: Editors Wanted'
created: 1334082998
---
The <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org">Code4Lib Journal</a> is looking for volunteers to join its editorial committee.  Editorial committee members work collaboratively to produce the quarterly Code4Lib Journal.  Editors are expected to:

<ul>
<li>Read, discuss, and vote on incoming proposals.</li>
<li>Volunteer to be the assigned editor or second reader for specific proposals.
  <ul>
  <li>Assigned editors work with the author(s) to make sure the article is as strong as possible, that the copy is clean, and deadlines are met.  They also enter the article into WordPress, making sure the formatting is okay, all images and tables look good, etc.</li>
  <li>Second readers act as a second set of eyes for the assigned editor.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Read and comment on any other article that interests you.</li>
<li>Volunteer for administrative tasks and projects as they crop up.</li>
<li>Take a turn as Coordinating Editor for an Issue.  The Coordinating Editor shepherds the issue through its life cycle.</li>
</ul>

We seek an individual who is self-motivated, organized and able to meet deadlines; is familiar with ideas and trends in the field; and has an interest in the mechanics of writing.  There is a sometimes significant time commitment involved; expect to set aside ten or more hours a month.

It sounds like a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun (if editing is your idea of fun).

Intrigued?  Please send a letter of interest by Monday, April 30 to [log in to unmask] Your letter should address these two basic questions:

<ol>
<li>What is your vision for the Code4Lib Journal? Why are you interested in it?</li>
<li>How can you contribute to the Code4Lib Journal, i.e. what do you have to offer?</li>
</ol>

We encourage people who have previously applied and who are still interested to re-apply. We have had to turn down a lot of highly-qualified people in the past due to the large number of applications.

If you have any questions, contact us by email at journal@code4lib.org or ask any member of the <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/editorial-committee">editorial committee</a>. We plan to make decisions about additional editors by mid-May.

v0.5.0 

- Extensive rewrite of MARC::Reader (ISO 2709 binary reader) to 
  provide a fairly complete and consistent handing of char encoding
  issues in ruby 1.9. 

  - This code is well covered by automated tests, but ends up complex, 
    there may be bugs, please report them. 

  - May not work properly under jruby with non-unicode source 
    encodings. 

  - Still can't handle Marc8 encoding. 

  - May not have entirely backwards compatible behavior with regard to 
    char encodings under ruby 1.9.x as previous 0.4.x versions. Test 
    your code. In particular, previous versions may have automatically 
    _transcoded_ non-unicode encodings to UTF-8 for you. This version 
    will not do so unless you ask it to with correct arguments.

We are now accepting proposals for Code4lib 2013.

Code4lib 2013 is a loosely-structured conference for library technologists to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be inspired, and forge collaborations. The conference will be held Monday February 11th (Preconference Day) - Thursday February 14th, 2013 in Chicago, IL. More information can be found on the <a href="http://tigger.uic.edu/~kayiwa/code4lib.html">host committee information page</a>. 

Head over to the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/2013_talks_proposals">call for proposals page on the Code4Lib Wiki</a> and submit your idea for a prepared talk for this year's conference! Proposals should be no longer than 500 words, and preferably many less.
<!--break-->
Prepared talks are 20 minutes (including setup and questions), and focus on one or more of the following areas:

<ul>
	<li>tools (some cool new software, software library or integration platform)</li>
	<li>specs (how to get the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones)</li>
	<li>challenges (one or more big problems we should collectively address)</li>
</ul>

The community will vote on proposals using the criteria of:
<ul>
	<li>usefulness</li>
	<li>newness</li>
	<li>geekiness</li>
	<li>uniqueness</li>
	<li>awesomeness</li>
</ul>

Proposals can be submitted through Friday, November 2nd, 5pm PT.  Voting will commence soon thereafter. The submitter (and if necessary a second presenter) will be guaranteed an opportunity to register for the conference.

<a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/2013_preconference_proposals">Proposals for preconferences</a> are also open until November 2nd, 5pm PT. 

We cannot accept every prepared talk proposal, but multiple lightning talk and breakout sessions will provide everyone who wishes to present with an opportunity to do so.

Looking forward to seeing your proposals!

<h2>Chicago</h2>
<h3>Getting Around</h3>
<strong>CTA</strong>
<p>Locals prefer the Chicago Transit Authority. You can pay in cash, but it's much easier (and a bit cheaper*) to purchase a <strong>transit card</strong>. You can buy one at the airport, the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&cid=1199797190489015342">Dominick's Grocery Store</a> 1/2 block north of the hotel on Halsted Street, or at any train station.</p>
<p>Get bus and train arrival time information from the <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/mobile/">CTA mobile site</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't have a transit card, a cash trip will cost you $2.25. Exact change is required.</p>
<p>*As of last month, it now costs $5 to travel to and from O'Hare airport via the train. Hello, tourist tax!</p>
<strong>Taxis</strong>
<p>Reasonably-priced for short trips around the Loop, but if you're going to the airport, the CTA is the more reliable (traffic-wise) and cheaper option.</p>
<p>Call or book online:</p>

</ul>
<strong>Walking</strong>
<p>If you're staying at the Crowne Plaza and fancy a walk, it will take you about 25 minutes. The stretch of Halsted Street south of the hotel goes through the heart of Chicago's lively <a href="http://www.greektownchicago.org/">Greektown</a> neighborhood.</p>
<p>Standard safety procedures apply: be aware of your surroundings, don't walk alone at night or if you're uncomfortable, etc. </p>

Last year Declan Fleming presented <a href="/conference/2012/fleming">ALL TEH METADATAS</a> and reviewed our UC San Diego Library Digital Asset Management system and RDF data model. You may be shocked to hear that all that metadata wasn't quite enough to handle increasingly complex digital library and research data in an elegant way. Our ad-hoc, 8-year-old data model has also been added to in inconsistent ways and our librarians and developers have not always been perfectly in sync in understanding how the data model has evolved over time.

In this presentation we'll review our process of locking a team of librarians and developers in a room to figure out a new data model, from domain definition through building and testing an OWL ontology. We¹ll also cover the challenges we ran into, including the review of existing controlled vocabularies and ontologies, or lack thereof, and the decisions made to cover the gaps. Finally, we'll discuss how we engaged the digital library community for feedback and what we have to do next. We all know that Things Fall Apart, this is our attempt at Doing Better This Time.

<strong>ARCHITECTING ScholarSphere: How We Built a Repository App That Doesn't Feel Like Yet Another Janky Old Repository App</strong>

<ul>

<li>Mike Giarlo, Penn State University, michael@psu.edu</li>
</ul>

ScholarSphere is a web application that allows the Penn State research community to deposit, share, and manage its scholarly works. It is also, as some of our users and our peers have observed, a repository app that feels much more like Google Docs or GitHub than earlier-generation repository applications. ScholarSphere is built upon the Hydra framework (Fedora Commons, Solr, Blacklight, Ruby on Rails), MySQL, Redis, Resque, FITS, ImageMagick, jQuery, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome. We'll talk about techniques we used to:
<ul>
<li>eliminate Fedora-isms in the application</li>
<li>model and expose RDF metadata in ways that users find unobtrusive</li>
<li>manage permissions via a UI widget that doesn't stab you in the face</li>
<li>harvest and connect controlled vocabularies (such as LCSH) to forms</li>
<li>make URIs cool</li>
<li>keep the app snappy without venturing into the architectural labyrinth of YAGNI</li>
<li>build and queue background jobs</li>
<li>expose social features and populate activity streams</li>
<li>tie checksum verification, characterization, and version control to the UI</li>
<li>let users upload and edit multiple files at once</li>
</ul>
The application will be demonstrated; code will be shown; and we solemnly commit to showing ABSOLUTELY NO XML.

The talk will see technical details of the special query class, its collectors, how to add a new search operator and how to influence relevance scores. Then you can type with me: friends_of(friends_of(cited_for(keyword:"black holes") AND keyword:"red dwarf"))

<strong>"Creating a Commons"</strong>

</ul>

The difference between an open source software project that gets new adopters and new contributing community members (which is to say, a project that goes on existing for any length of time) and a project that doesn't, often isn't a question of superior design or technology. It's more often a question of whether the advocates for the project can convince institutional leaders AND front line developers that a project is stable and trustworthy. What are successful strategies for attracting development partners? I'll try to answer that and talk about what we could do as a community to make collaboration easier.

<strong>EAD without XSLT: A Practical New Approach to Web-Based Finding Aids</strong>
<br/>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/trevorthornton/tthornton-code4lib">Slide presentation</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Trevor Thornton, New York Public Library, trevorthornton@nypl.org</li>
</ul>

The New York Public Library is reengineering its system for delivering archival finding aids on the Web. The foundation of this system is a data management application, written in Rails, within which collections and their components are managed as associated model instances, and descriptive data is stored natively as JSON and HTML. Front-end applications interact with the back-end via a flexible API that is capable of returning any part of the description at any level. This approach provides a number of benefits over the traditional XML/XSLT approach:
<ul>
<li>Data is stored natively in the format in which it is needed by the front-end application, making rendering much faster</li>
<li>Finding aid data can be lazy-loaded via AJAX requests</li>
<li>Enables presentation of the archival description beyond the traditional finding aid structure (alternate arrangements, visualizations, etc.)</li>
<li>Links to digital assets can be maintained independently of archival description</li>
<li>Data cleanup and normalization can be accomplished during and/or after ingest of original data into the system, ensuring data quality and consistency</li>
<li>Data is stored in a schema-neutral format, enabling easy transformation into other formats as required (e.g. RDF for semantic web applications, future version(s) of EAD schema for harvesting, etc.)</li>
</ul>

In this session I will describe the architecture of this system and its data model, and discuss the challenges presented in the design process.

<strong>Evolving Towards a Consortium MARCR Redis Datastore</strong>

<ul>
<li>Jeremy Nelson, Colorado College, jeremy.nelson@coloradocollege.edu</li>
<li>Sheila Yeh, University of Denver, Sheila.Yeh@du.edu</li>
</ul>

The current state of technology in library automation is not keeping pace with the explosive growth in information storage and retrieval system. The lag costs institutions as well as users’ resource discovery. To address this problem, we should look into how successfully enterprise such as Craigslist and StackOverflow manage and scale their enormous volume of data. The key lies in the Redis, a NoSQL open source advanced key-value data structure server. Therefore, Colorado College and the University of Denver, along with the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries are exploring and co-developing a MARCR Redis Datastore. It is a peer-to-peer bibliographic datastore, modeled using the Library of Congress Bibliographic Framework's new Linked Data based MARC 21 replacement, called MARCR (MARC Resources). The structure of MARCR leads itself to an advanced Consortium catalog where a Work is cataloged once and multiple institutions have complete control over their own Instances of the Work, de-duplicating cataloging efforts while supporting real-time resource sharing between the Instances. Control, access, and discovery of records in the proposed MARCR Redis Datastore are provided through lightweight HTML5 responsive apps built with Django, Bootstrap, and KnockoutJS that also integrate with both open-source and commercial discovery products.

Redis offers many advantages for a shared MARCR bibliographic datastore, such as speed, scalability, and ease-of-deployment. Especially it can support multiple cloud models that benefits institution of various size and capital. We will demonstrate a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) iteration of this MARCR Datastore using the transformed MARC 21 records from Colorado College and the University of Denver into Redis with coordination by Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries.

The NCSU Libraries is using Google Analytics increasingly across its website as a replacement for usage tracking via Urchin. More recently, we have also begun to use the event tracking features in Google Analytics. This has allowed us to gather usage statistics for activities that don’t initiate new requests to the server, such as clicks that hide and show already-loaded content (as in many tabbed interfaces). Aggregating these events together with pageview tracking in Google Analytics presents a more unified picture of patron activity and can help improve design of tools like the library catalog. While assuming a basic understanding of the use of Google Analytics pageview tracking, this presentation will start with an introduction to the event tracking capabilities that may be less widely known.

We’ll share library catalog usage data pulled from Google Analytics, including information about features that are common across the newest wave of catalog interfaces, such as tabbed content, Google Preview, and shelf browse. We will also cover the approach taken for the technical implementation of this data-intensive JavaScript event tracking.

As a counterpart, we can demonstrate how we have begun to use Google Analytics event tracking in a proprietary vendor discovery tool (Serials Solutions Summon). While the same technical ideas govern this implementation, we can highlight the differences (read, challenges) inherent in utilizing this type of event tracking in vendor-owned application vs. a locally developed application.

Along the way, hopefully you’ll learn a little about why you might (or might not) want to use Google Analytics event tracking yourself and see some interesting catalog usage stats.

<li>Sam Klein, Wikipedia, metasj AT gmail.com</li>
</ul>

The Digital Public Library of America is a growing open-source platform to support digital libraries and archives of all kinds. DPLA-alpha is available for testing, with data from six initial Hubs. New APIs and data feeds are in development, with the next release scheduled for April.

Come learn what we are doing, how to contribute or hack the DPLA roadmap, and how you (or your favorite institution) can draw from and publish through it. Larger institutions can join as a (content or service) hub, helping to aggregate and share metadata and services from across their {region, field, archive-type}. We will discuss current challenges and possibilities (UI and API suggestions wanted!), apps being built on the platform, and related digitization efforts.

DPLA has a transparent community and planning process; new participants are always welcome. Half the time will be for suggestions and discussion. Please bring proposals, problems, partnerships and possible paradoxes to discuss.

Transition points in who is the primary developer on an actively developing code base can be a source of frustration for everyone involved. We've tried to minimize that pain point as much as possible through the use of agile methods like test driven development, continuous integration, and modular design. Has optimizing for developer happiness brought us happiness? What's worked, what hasn't, and what's worth adopting? How do you keep your project in a state where you can easily hand it off?

<strong>Hybrid Archival Collections Using Blacklight and Hydra</strong>

<ul>
<li>Adam Wead, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, awead@rockhall.org</li>
</ul>

At the Library and Archives of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, we use available tools such as Archivists' Toolkit to create EAD finding aids of our collections. However, managing digital content created from these materials and the born-digital content that is also part of these collections represents a significant challenge. In my presentation, I will discuss how we solve the problem of our hybrid collections by using Hydra as a digital asset manager and Blacklight as a unified presentation and discovery interface for all our materials.

Our strategy centers around indexing ead xml into Solr as multiple documents: one for each collection, and one for every series, sub-series and item contained within a collection. For discovery, we use this strategy to leverage item-level searching of archival collections alongside our traditional library content. For digital collections, we use this same technique to represent a finding aid in Hydra as a set of linked objects using RDF. New digital items are then linked to these parent objects at the collection and series level. Once this is done, the items can be exported back out to the Blacklight solr index and the digital content appears along with the rest of the items in the collection.

It is hoped that this prototype will be a model for a new kind of interface to library, archive & museum metadata targeted to particular subject domains, and could inform the development of a similar dis- and re- aggregation approach for entire library collections.

  Luker, IT Specialist, Smithsonian Astrophysics Data System, jluker@cfa.harvard.edu</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nWhen
  it comes to author names the disconnect between our metadata and what a user might
  enter into a search box presents challenges when trying to maximize both precision
  and recall [0]. When indexing a paper written by \"Wäterwheels, A\" a goal should
  be to preserve as much as possible the original information. However, users searching
  by author name may frequently omit the diaeresis and search for simply, \"Waterwheels\".
  The reverse of this scenario is also possible, i.e., your decrepit metadata contains
  only the ASCII, \"Supybot, Zoia\", whereas the user enters, \"Supybot, Zóia\". If
  recall is your highest priority the simple solution is to always downgrade to ASCII
  when indexing and querying. However this strategy sacrifices precision, as you will
  be unable to provide an \"exact\" search, necessary in cases where \"Hacker, J\"
  and \"Häcker, J\" really are two distinct authors.\r\n\r"

When it comes to author names the disconnect between our metadata and what a user might enter into a search box presents challenges when trying to maximize both precision and recall [0]. When indexing a paper written by "Wäterwheels, A" a goal should be to preserve as much as possible the original information. However, users searching by author name may frequently omit the diaeresis and search for simply, "Waterwheels". The reverse of this scenario is also possible, i.e., your decrepit metadata contains only the ASCII, "Supybot, Zoia", whereas the user enters, "Supybot, Zóia". If recall is your highest priority the simple solution is to always downgrade to ASCII when indexing and querying. However this strategy sacrifices precision, as you will be unable to provide an "exact" search, necessary in cases where "Hacker, J" and "Häcker, J" really are two distinct authors.

This talk will describe the strategy ADS[1] has devised for addressing common and edge-case problems faced when dealing with author name indexing and searching. I will cover the approach we devised to not only the transliteration issue described above, but also how we deal with author initials vs. full first and/or middle names, authors who have published under different forms of their name, authors who change their names (wha? people get married?!). Our implementation relies on Solr/Lucene[2], but my goal is an 80/20 mix of high- vs. low-level details to keep things both useful and stackgnostic [3].

<strong>Pitfall! Working with Legacy Born Digital Materials in Special Collections</strong>
<br/>

</ul>

Archives and special collections are being faced with a growing abundance of born digital material, as well as an abundance of many promising tools for managing them. However, one must consider the potential problems that can arise when approaching a collection containing legacy materials (from roughly the pre-internet era). Many of the tried and true, "best of breed" tools for digital preservation don't always work as they do for more recent materials, requiring a fair amount of ingenuity and use of "word of mouth tradecraft and knowledge exchanged through serendipitous contacts, backchannel conversations, and beer" (Kirschenbaum, "Breaking badflag").

Our presentation will focus on some of the strange problems encountered and creative solutions devised by two digital archivists in the course of preserving, processing, and providing access to collections at their institutions. We'll be placing particular particular emphasis of the pitfalls and crocodiles we've learned to swing over safely, while collecting treasure in the process. We'll address working with CP/M disks in collections of authors' papers, reconstructing a multipart hard drive backup spread across floppy disks, and more.

<strong>REST IS Your Mobile Strategy </strong>
<ul>
<li>Richard Wolf, University of Illinois at Chicago, richwolf@uic.edu</li>
</ul>

Mobile is the new hotness ... and you can't be one of the cool kids unless you've got your own mobile app ... but the road to mobility is daunting. I'll argue that it's actually easier than it seems ... and that the simplest way to mobility is to bring your data to the party, create a REST API around the data, tell developers about your API, and then let the magic happen. To make my argument concrete, I'll show (lord help me!) how to go from an interesting REST API to a fun iOS tool for librarians and the general public in twenty minutes.

<strong>Solr Update</strong>

Solr is continually improving. Solr 4 was recently released, bringing dramatic changes in the underlying Lucene library and Solr-level features. It's tough for us all to keep up with the various versions and capabilities.

This talk will blaze through the highlights of new features and improvements in Solr 4 (and up). Topics will include: SolrCloud, direct spell checking, surround query parser, and many other features. We will focus on the features library coders really need to know about.

<strong>The Avalon Media System: A Next Generation Hydra Head For Audio and Video Delivery</strong>
<br/>

<ul>
<li>Michael Klein, Senior Software Developer, Northwestern University LIbrary, michael.klein AT northwestern DOT edu</li>
<li>Nathan Rogers, Programmer/Analyst, Indiana University, rogersna AT indiana DOT edu</li>
</ul>

Based on the success of the <a href="http://www.dml.indiana.edu/">Variations</a> digital music platform, Indiana University and Northwestern University have developed a next generation educational tool for delivering multimedia resources to the classroom. The Avalon Media System (formerly Variations on Video) supports the ingest, media processing, management, and access-controlled delivery of library-managed video and audio collections. To do so, the system draws on several existing, mature, open source technologies:
<ul>
<li>The ingest, search, and discovery functionality of the Hydra framework</li>
<li>The powerful multimedia workflow management features of Opencast Matterhorn</li>
<li>The flexible Engage audio/video player</li>
<li>The streaming capabilities of both Red5 Media Server (open source) and Adobe Flash Media Server (proprietary)</li>
</ul>

Extensive customization options are built into the framework for tailoring the application to the needs of a specific institution.

Our goal is to create an open platform that can be used by other institutions to serve the needs of the academic community. Release 1 is planned for a late February launch with future versions released every couple of months following.

</ul>

After a low-tech experiment in crowdsourced transcription grew into a surprisingly successful library initiative and demanded new commitments to user engagement, we found ourselves looking for a more efficient and user-friendly solution. We customized CHNM’s Scripto community transcription tool and various other Omeka plugins to develop a new site: DIYHistory.

We often receive questions about the technical side of both platforms, usually (to our dismay) from libraries who already assume they don't have the IT resources to pursue their own crowdsourcing initiatives. But we found that the software makes up only half of the recipe for success. Do you have compelling content? A long-term commitment to engaging with your users? Are you ready to promote your project far and wide? If so, then deploying a crowdsourcing initiative may be easier than you think.

Our very small development team, which consisted of a healthy mix of technologists and other stakeholders, worked closely and collaboratively on all aspects of the site. We’ll talk about customizing open-source software--how we scaled up functionality and scaled back design to improve user experience and production-level workflows--and how that process served to gently introduce collaborative software practices, such as using Git for version control, into a small, but agile, organization ready to grow. Finally, we'll share our transcription starter kit of forked Scipto and Omeka code and associated documentation for those interested in doing it themselves.

 <strong>Ask Anything!</strong>
<br>
Wherein you ask...anything, a.k.a. "Human Search Engine". A chance for you to ask a roomful of code4libbers anything that's on your mind: questions seeking answers (short or long), requests for things (hardware, software, skills, or help), or offers of things. We'll keep the pace fast, and the answers faster. 
<br>Come with questions and line up at the start of the session and we'll go through as many as we can; sometimes we'll stop at finding the right person or people to answer a query and it'll be up to you to find each other after the session.  If you don't ask questions, you get a stand-up routine, and poorly told jokes. (No pirates this year...)

Engy Morsy, Bibliotheca Alexandrina (The new Library of Alexandria)

A lot of institutions around the world are engaged in multiple digitization projects aiming at preserving the human knowledge present in books and availing them through multiple channels to people around the whole globe. These efforts will sure help close the digital gap particularly with the arrival of affordable e-readers, mobile phones and network coverage. However, the digital reading experience has not yet arrived to its maximum potential. Many readers miss features they like in their good old books and wish to find them in their digital counterpart. In an attempt to create a unique digital reading experience, Bibliotheca Alexandria (BA) created a flexible book viewing framework that is currently used to access its current collection of more than 300,000 digital books in five different languages which includes the largest collection of digitized Arabic books.

Using open source tools, BA used the framework to develop a modular book viewer that can be deployed in different environments and is currently at the heart of various BA projects. The Book viewer provides several features creating a more natural reading experience. As with physical books, the reader can now personalize the books he reads by adding annotations like highlights, underlines and sticky notes to capture his thoughts and ideas in addition to being able to share the book with friends on social networks. The reader can perform a search across the content of the book receiving highlighted search results within the pages of the book. More features can be further added to the book viewer through its plugin architecture.

Mike Graves, MIT Libraries

You've got maps. You even scanned and georeferenced them. Now what? Running a full GIS stack can be expensive, and overkill in some cases. The good news is that you have a lot more options now than you did just a few years ago. I'd like to present some lighter weight solutions to making georeferenced images available on the Web.

This talk will provide an introduction to MBTiles. I'll go over what they are, how you create them, how you use them and why you would use them.

---
Jill Sexton, Mike Daines, Greg Jansen, UNC Chapel Hill Libraries

Patron-initiated ingest of complex, multi-part objects into digital preservation environments remains a challenging problem for many libraries. In this talk we discuss how we approached this problem at UNC Chapel Hill.

UNC Chapel Hill Libraries is the developer of the Curator’s Workbench, (download: <a href="http://www2.lib.unc.edu/software/">http://www2.lib.unc.edu/software/</a> GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/Curators-Workbench/wiki">https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/Curators-Workbench/wiki</a>) an open-source collections preparation and work flow tool for digital materials. In response to the demand for patron-initiated ingest into our preservation repository, we extended the functionality of the Workbench, creating a module that enables easy creation of web deposit forms suitable for varying content types. The forms use dictionary and crosswalk mapping components to map the input fields to the MODS schema. Form designs also include explanatory text and designation of required fields. The forms work in tandem with a server-side form-hosting application, which can be configured to put uploads and MODS records onto a filesystem, or to deposit materials into a repository via SWORD. The forms feature simplifies the creation of deposit forms, shifting form design from software developers to curators, who have greater familiarity with both the depositor community and with descriptive standards. We also shift metadata creation to the content creators, who have the most knowledge of submitted materials.

We will demonstrate how this process works for the submission of Studio Art MFA theses. These complex deposits consist of a narrative description of the artwork in addition to up to 20 video- or image-based files documenting of their work, and associated metadata for each file. In addition to preserving MFA projects in a stable environment, this procedure gives graduate students greater control over the submission and description process and provides online access to MFA Art Theses and supporting works. Additionally, the project has invited discussions with MFA students about the preservation of their personal archives.

Our talk will address how these tools could work within other digital preservation environments

<li>One repository contains untold numbers of digital objects and powers many Hydra and Islandora apps
It speaks RDF, but contains no triplestore! (triplestores sold separately, SPARQL Update may be involved, some restrictions apply)</li>
<li>Flexible enough to tie itself in knots implementing storage and access control policies</li>

<li>Watch novice developers setup Fedora 4 from scratch, with just a handful of incantations to Git and Maven</li>
</ul>
The Fedora Commons Repository is the foundation of many digital collections, e-research, digital library, archives, digital preservation, institutional repository and open access publishing systems. This talk will focus on how Fedora 4 improves core repository functionality, adds new features, maintains backwards compatibility, and addresses the shortcomings of Fedora 3.

Michael B Klein, Senior Software Developer, and Julie Rudder, Digital Initiatives Project Manager, Northwestern University

<a href="http://www.avalonmediasystem.org/">Avalon Media System</a> is a collaborative effort between development teams at Northwestern and Indiana Universities. Our goal is to produce an open source media management platform that works well for us, but is also widely adopted and contributed to by other institutions. We believe that building a strong user and contributor community is vital to the success and longevity of the project, and have developed the system with this goal in mind. We will share lessons learned, pains and successes we’ve had releasing two versions of the application since last year.

Our presentation will cover our experiences:

<ul>
<li>providing flexible, admin-friendly distribution and installation options</li>
<li>building with abstraction, customization and local integrations in mind</li>
<li>prioritizing features (user stories)</li>
<li>attracting code contributions from other institutions</li>
<li>gathering community feedback</li>
<li>creating a product rather than a bag of parts</li>

Content management is hard. To keep all the moving parts in order, and to maintain a layer of separation between the system and content creators (who are frequently not technical experts), we typically turn to content management systems like Drupal. But even Drupal and its kin require significant overhead and present a not inconsiderable learning curve for nontechnical users.

Even better, the basic method is HTML5-friendly, and can be integrated into your favorite content management system if you've got permissions for creating templates.

In the presentation I'll go into detail about the system structure and logic required to implement this approach. I'll detail the benefits and limitations of the system, as well as the challenges I encountered in developing its implementation. Audience members should come away with sufficient background to implement a similar system on their own servers. Implementation documentation and genericized code will also be shared, as available.

title: Discovering your Discovery System in Real Time
created: 1390333692
---
Godmar Back and Annette Bailey, Virginia Tech

Practically all libraries today provide web-based discovery systems to their users; users discover items and peruse or check them out by clicking on links. Unlike the traditional transaction of checking out a book at the circulation desk, this interaction is largely invisible. We have built a system that records user's interaction with Summon in real-time, processes the resulting data with minimal delay, and visualizes it in various ways using Google Charts and using various d3.js modules, such as word clouds, tree maps, and others.

These visualizations can be embedded in web sites, but are also suitable for projection via large-scale displays or projectors right into the 'Learning Spaces' many libraries are converted into. The goal of this talk is to share the technology and advocate the building of a cloud-based infrastructure that would make this technology available to any library that uses a discovery system, rather than just those who have the technological prowess for developing such systems and visualizations in-house.

created: 1390335096

Kevin Beswick, NCSU Libraries 

With a significant portion of the collection at our new Hunt Library being housed in an automated storage and retrieval system, several of us at NCSU Libraries have begun looking at ways to replace and improve upon the classic shelf browsing experience in order to make it easier for patrons to browse related materials. Our goal is to mimic popular services like Amazon and Netflix, which utilize recommendation engines to make it easy for users to find items similar to a particular item of interest. While there have been previous efforts in libraries to recreate this experience using circulation or call number data, we are currently investigating algorithms that focus on use of subject headings. Use of subject headings as an alternative can be particularly helpful in the case of electronic materials that do not always have call numbers or circulation data. In this talk, I will share:

<ul>
<li>Details of the proposed algorithms</li>
<li>How these algorithms were quickly and easily implemented using Solr.</li>
<li>Our evaluation process and its outcomes in terms of the effectiveness of the algorithms.</li>
<li>How this has (or could) impact presentation of recommended items in our discovery layer.</li>

Anne-Lena Westrum, Benjamin Rokseth, Asgeir Rekkavik, Petter Goksøyr Åsen

Oslo Public Library has converted the entire MARC-catalogue to RDF via the self-made conversion tool MARC2RDF.

<a href="http://data.deichman.no">data.deichman.no</a>, the enriched RDF version of the library catalogue including its authority files, forms the basis for two different mashups; The Active shelf and the Book recommendation database. The RDF catalogue is linked with various content and the dataset is updated daily to account for additions, deletions and changes made in the MARC catalogue.

<a href="http://vimeo.com/68687814%7C">The Active shelf</a> is a physical touchscreen device that makes use of open source software, RFID technology, RDF data and external web service APIs to provide information about any library book a patron is curious to know more about.

The Book recommendations database stores book recommendations written by library staff from all over Norway and links them to the RDF-representation of the MARC-catalogue.

Building web services can have great benefits by providing reusability of data and functionality. Underpinning your applications with a web service will allow you to write code once and support multiple environments: your library's web app, mobile applications, the embedded widget in your campus portal. However, building a web service is its own kind of artful programming. Doing it well requires attention to many of the same techniques and requirements as building web applications, though with different outcomes.

So what are the usability principles for web services? How do you build a web service that you (and others) will actually want to use?

<li>Building web services that behave as a suite so it looks like the left hand knows what the right hand is doing</li>
</ul>

So at the end of the day, your team will know your API is a very good egg after all.

The presenters intend to produce and share a Quick Guide for building a web service that will reflect content presented in the talk.

title: Personalize your Google Analytics Data with Custom Events and Variables
created: 1390333588

Josh Wilson, Systems Integration Librarian, State Library of North Carolina 

At the State Library of North Carolina, we had more specific questions about the use of our digital collections than standard GA could provide. A few implementations of custom events and custom variables later, we have our answers.

I'll demonstrate how these analytics add-ons work, and why implementation can sometimes be more complicated than just adding a few lines of JavaScript to your ga.js. I'll discuss some specific examples in use at the SLNC:

<ul>
<li>Capturing the content of specific metadata fields in CONTENTdm as Custom Events</li>
<li>Recording Drupal taxonomy terms as Custom Variables</li>
</ul>

In both instances, this data deepened our understanding of how our sites and collections were being used, and in turn, we were able to report usage more accurately to content contributors and other stakeholders.

excerpt: "Birkin James Diana, Brown University\r\n\r\nIn 2007 we built a system that
  dumped certain user web-requests for books into a database for offline-processing

title: Queue Programming -- how using job queues can make the Library coding world
  a better place
created: 1390337743

Birkin James Diana, Brown University

In 2007 we built a system that dumped certain user web-requests for books into a database for offline-processing triggered via cron. We wanted to make the magic happen live, but knew it would take too long. Thus we created, sort of accidentally, a kind of old-fashioned static procedural job queue.

Over the years we we've been repeatedly impressed with how useful and robust this unintended architecture has been, and it fostered thinking about using real job queues in Library workflows.

Fast-forward to the present. We now are using _real_ job queueing, in production, for parts of the functioning of Brown Digital Repository. We've also used it for ingestion scripts, and plan to move more lots more code to this architecture.

I'd like to share & show:

<ul>
<li>our lightweight rq/redis job queueing setup</li>
<li>how using job queues can speed up workflows via using multiple workers</li>
<li>how job queueing can make workflows more robust, especially by simplifying failure handling</li>
<li>a way we've smoothly avoided race-conditions that can occur in concurrent-programming</li>
<li>a technique for using task-processing job queues to simplify complex workflows</li>
</ul>

Bohyun Kim, University of Maryland, Baltimore - Health Sciences and Human Services Library.

Slides: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bohyunkim/quick-easy-data-visualization-with-google-visualization-api-google-chart-libraries">http://www.slideshare.net/bohyunkim/quick-easy-data-visualization-with-google-visualization-api-google-chart-libraries</a>

Code: <a href="https://github.com/bohyunkim/examples">https://github.com/bohyunkim/examples</a>

Do most of the data that your library collects stay in spreadsheets or are published as a static table with a series of boring numbers? Do your library stakeholders spend more time collecting the data than using it as a decision-making tool because the data is presented in a way that makes it hard for them to quickly grasp its significance?

This talk will provide an overview of Google Visualization API [2] and Google Chart Libraries [3] to get you started on the way to quickly query and visualize your library data from remote data sources (e.g. a Google Spreadsheet or your own database) with (or without) cool-looking user-controls, animation effects, and even a dashboard.

title: 'Structured data NOW: seeding schema.org in library systems'
created: 1390333772
---
Dan Scott, Laurentian University

The semantic web, linked data, and structured data are all fantastic ideas with a barrier imposed by implementation constraints. If their system does not allow customizations, or the institution lacks skilled human resources, it does not matter how enthused a given library might be about publishing structured data... it will not happen. However, if the software in use simply publishes structured data by default, then the web will be populated for free. Really! No extra resources necessary.

This presentation highlights Dan's work with systems such as Evergreen, Koha, and VuFind to enable the publication of schema.org structured data out-of-the-box. Along the way, we reflect the current state of the W3C Schema.org Bibliographic Extension community group efforts to shape the evolution of the schema.org vocabulary. Finally, hold on tight as we contemplate next steps and the possibilities of a world where structured data is the norm on the web.

JavaScript MVC frameworks are ushering in a golden age of robust and responsive web applications that take advantage of evergreen browsers, performant JS engines, and the unprecedented reach provided by billions of personal computing devices. The web browser has emerged as the world’s most popular application runtime and the complexity[1] and scope of JavaScript applications has exploded accordingly. Server-side web frameworks like Rails and Django have helped developers adhere to best practices like modularity, dependency injection, and unit testing for years, practices that are now being applied to JavaScript development through projects like Backbone[2], Ember[3], and Angular[4].

This talk will discuss the issues JavaScript MVC frameworks are trying to solve, common features like data binding, implications for the future of web development[5], and the appropriateness of JavaScript MVC for library applications.

Roy Tennant, OCLC Research

<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</a> is widely used by Yahoo!, Google, and many others to process massive amounts of data quickly. OCLC Research uses a 40-node compute cluster with Hadoop and HBase to process the 300 million MARC records of WorldCat in various ways. This presentation will explain how Hadoop MapReduce works and illustrate it with specific examples and code. The role of the jobtracker in both monitoring and reporting on processes will be explained. String searching WorldCat will also be demonstrated live.

title: Visualizing Library Resources as Networks
created: 1390335846
---
Matt Miller, New York Public Library, NYPL Labs.

Library resources are typically presented linearly in the form of a catalog search results page or an iterative list of subjects, books, special collections, etc. This talk explores the possibilities created when thinking of library resources as interconnected networks. We will look at the progress of a project to visualize NYPL resources such as catalog subject headings[1][2] as a network. We will also look at moving beyond visualizations into building network interfaces, such as our archival access term explorer[3] prototype.

title: Visualizing Solr Search Results with D3.js for User-Friendly Navigation of
  Large Results Sets
created: 1390335713
---
Julia Bauder, Grinnell College Libraries

As the corpus of articles, books, and other resources searched by discovery systems continues to get bigger, searchers are more and more frequently confronted with unmanageably large numbers of results. How can we help users make sense of 10,000 hits and find the ones they actually want? Facets help, but making sense of a gigantic sidebar of facets is not an easy task for users, either. During this talk, I will explain how we will soon be using Solr 4’s pivot queries and hierarchical visualizations (e.g., treemaps) from D3.js to let patrons view and manipulate search results. We will be doing this with our VuFind 2.0 catalog, but this technique will work with any system running Solr 4. I will also talk about early student reaction to our tests of these visualization features.

title: We Are All Disabled! Universal Web Design Making Web Services Accessible for
  Everyone
created: 1390335930
---
Cynthia Ng, Accessibility Librarian, CAPER-BC at Langara College

We’re building and improving tools and services all the time, but do you only develop for the “average” user or add things for “disabled” users? We all use “assistive” technology accessing information in a multitude of ways with different platforms, devices, etc. Let’s focus on providing web services that are accessible to everyone without it being onerous or ugly. The aim is to get you thinking about what you can do to make web-based services and content more accessible for all from the beginning or with small amounts of effort whether you're a developer or not.

The goal of the presentation is to provide both developers and content creators with information on simple, practical ways to make web content and web services more accessible. However, rather than thinking about putting in extra effort or making adjustment for those with disabilities, I want to help people think about how to make their websites more accessible for all users through universal web design.

title: WebSockets for Real-Time and Interactive Interfaces
created: 1390333077
---
Jason Ronallo, NCSU Libraries

Watching the Google Analytics Real-Time dashboard for the first time was mesmerizing. As soon as someone visited a site, I could see what page they were on. For a digital collections site with a lot of images, it was fun to see what visitors were looking at. But getting from Google Analytics to the image or other content of what was currently being viewed was cumbersome. The real-time experience was something I wanted to share with others. I'll show you how I used a WebSocket service to create a real-time interface to digital collections views and search queries.

In the Hunt Library at NCSU we have some large video walls. I wanted to make HTML-based exhibits that featured viewer interactions. I'll show you how I converted Listen to Wikipedia [1] into an bring-your-own-device interactive exhibit. With WebSockets any HTML page can be remote controlled by any internet connected device.

I will attempt to include real-time audience participation.

created: 1391479836
---
Code4Lib seeks to provide a welcoming, fun, and safe community and conference experience and ongoing community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery
(including sexual) is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list.

Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment.  It includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious beliefs, sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online), deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of  talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>

1. Initial Incident

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please inform the offender that he/she has affected you negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by having that initial discussion.

2. Escalation 

If the offender insists that he/she did not offend, or if offender is actively harassing you, then you will need a third party to step in.

If you are at a conference or other event, find the event organizer or staff person. For #c4l14, that would be <b>Tim McGeary</b>. <i>If you can't find the event organizer, please notify the CONCENTRA staff at the Registration Desk to help if the situation calls for immediate action.</i>

If you are logged into the <a href="http://code4lib.org/irc">#code4lib IRC channel</a>, the command <b>@helpers</b> can be entered which will cause the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Zoia_or_the_Code4Lib_IRC_bot">zoia robot</a> to list people designated as channel helpers. There should be at least one helper in the channel most times.

For the listserv, you have a free-for-all for public messages; however, the listserv does have a maintainer, <b>Eric Lease Morgan</b>.

3. Wider community response to Incident:

If the incident doesn't pass the first step (discussion reveals offense was unintentional, apologies said, public note or community is informed of resolution), then there's not much the community can do at this point since the incident was resolved without outside intervention.

If incident results in corrective action, the community should support the decision made by the Help in Step 2 if they choose corrective action, like ending a talk early or banning from the listserv, as well as support those harmed by the incident, either publicly or privately (whatever individuals are comfortable with).

If the Help in Step 2 run into issues implementing the CoC, then the Help should come to the community with these issues and the community should revise the CoC as they see fit.

In Real Life people will have opinions about how the CoC is enforced. People will argue that a particular decision was unfair, and others will say that it didn't go far enough. We really can't stop people having opinions, but what we could do here is have constructive discussions that lead to something tangible (affirmation of decision, change in CoC, modify decision, etc,), instead of reproducing the comments section of a story on a news site.

<h3>Sanctions</h3>

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the Code4Lib event, or banning the offender from a chatroom or mailing list.

Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:

* warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in other sanctions
* requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
* early termination of a talk that violates the policy
* not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
* not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event
* immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future Code4lib events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
* banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* publishing an account of the harassment

<i>Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges</i>, and will help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. Code4Lib IRC volunteers can be identified by issuing the `@helpers` command in the #code4lib IRC channel (see above).

<b>If an incident occurs, please use the following contact information:</b>

* ** Conference organizers: Conference organizers are recognizable by a marking on their nametag; CONCENTRA Staff will be at the Registration Desk; and Tim McGeary, Chair of the Conference Committee.
* ** Sheraton Raleigh Hotel: 888-974-3068
* ** Raleigh Police Department: Emergency, 911 ; Non-emergency but response needed: 919-831-6311
* ** Sexual Assault Crisis Line (24/hr, by <a href="http://www.interactofwake.org/">Interact</a>): 866-291-0853 
* ** TaxiTaxi: 1-919-333-3333 [Also the TaxiMagic smartphone app]
* ** IRC channel helpers: enter "@helpers" in the IRC channel

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues, conference-related social events, community gatherings, and online communication channels.

We value your participation in the Code4Lib community, and your efforts to keep Code4Lib a safe and friendly space for all participants!

* Based on the <a  href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment">example policy</a> from the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/">Geek Feminism wiki</a>, created by the <a href="http://adainitiative.org/">Ada Initiative</a> and other volunteers.*

Code4Lib Conference 2014
Scholarship Brief Report


Arie Nugraha
University of Indonesia




For me, the Code4Lib Conference 2014 was not only the first conference that I've attended abroad, but also my gateway for my first step in the United States. First I want to say, a big thank you to all scholarship sponsors, Council on Library and Information Resources/Digital Library Federation, EBSCO, ProQuest and also Sumana Harihareswara, without their generous sponsorship, it would have been impossible for me to come to Code4Lib Conference 2014.


Two words are enough to express my feeling toward the conference, unbelievable and amazing. Unbelievable because I CAN come to this conference, and amazing because I’ve been surrounded by many great people who share their amazing knowledge and skill, from libraries, archives and museums, that I’ve never seen before in my country Indonesia. What I’ve  experienced in Code4lib Conference 2014 is an overwhelming new knowledge, that motivates me to always learn new library related technologies, and also the most important thing is, I met with great people with great hospitality. Code4Lib Conference hospitality makes me feel that I’m not an alien among conference attendees, since I’m coming from Indonesia, a country far away from The United States.


I learned many things from this conference. From this conference I know that we’ve come to the era where knowledge discovery has become more and more important to help library users to find what they need. APIs have become more and more important to learn and develop, they become standard if you intend to collaborate with other softwares. Web standards such as RDF, JSON, XML, YAML, etc. are playing a vital role when we talk about APIs, the choices that fall to us, and that is the beauty of open source and open standards, IMO. I also found that open source data visualization tools such as D3.js are also important to grasp, to create a pure HTML5 visualization as we move away from proprietary standards such as Flash. HTML5 and Javascript, combined with an API and also backend frameworks such as Rails and Django are once again proving that open source and open standards are the solid foundation of Web.


Talking about future proof library, the tour to The Hunt Library made me jealous of NCSU. The facilities provided are awesome, from The BookBot, Game Room, Maker Room, Learning Commons and simulation room. I think, the concept of colors in The Hunt Library is brilliant, stairs are painted in yellow to encourage users using stairs instead of elevator, and that happened to me!


Matt Miller’s presentation about visualizing library resources as a network really awed me on how powerful visualization can be. I am also very inspired by Bess Sadler’s presentation, about sustaining open source projects through training, because of what she said actually happened in SLiMS ILS open source project, the project that I am a part of. The Lightning Talks are cool too, from the first day to the last day, I can’t move my eye from each presenter, because they are all very exciting to watch. Five minutes for each presentation and it takes creativity to create a concise but powerful presentation, and I’m proud to have been one of the Lightning Talk presenters at Code4Lib 2014. Last but not least the closing keynote interview with Valerie Aurora on Ada initiative, gives me courage to always be confident around people with higher skill, and not affected by “Imposter Syndrome”.


APIs, Javascript, Data Visualization, and Resource Discovery are the main ideas that I take away from Code4Lib 2014, and all of them will be my main consideration for my existing and future open source projects. This conference really opens my eyes of how librarians can be! Salute and thank you to all the committees and volunteers, they did a very great job making this conference run well. Some problems happened such as the slow Internet connection, but I think the blame goes to the hotel which didn’t prepare well, maybe in the next conference, we must prepare a backup plan to avoid this kind of problem. Thank you for this great opportunity Code4Lib 2014, and hopefully I can attend the future Code4Lib conferences. I miss the Code4Lib conference already right now.

A Newbie, Troublesome Cataloger at Code4Lib

Christina Harlow

In March 2014, I attended my first (and definitely not only) Code4Lib National Conference. I had been following the Code4Lib group via their website, journal, wiki and local NYC chapter for some time; but being a metadata/cataloging person, I was hesitant to jump into a meeting of programmers, coders, systems librarians, and others. I am immensely glad that I did not let this hesitation hold me back this year, as the 2014 Code4Lib Conference was the best and most inviting conference that I have ever attended.
        
I planned to be in Raleigh, North Carolina, for the entirety of the conference – from Monday’s pre-conference workshops through to the closing remarks that Thursday afternoon. It was difficult to choose just two pre-conference workshops to attend, and I am still reading through the notes/tweets created by the different workshop participants. Looking through these notes, it appears that the Technology, Librarianship, and Gender pre-conference group had a great meeting that underscored the relevancy of both the opening and closing keynote speakers; also, the OpenRefine workshop helped a lot of the participants and interested me, as I work with a Linked Open Data version of OpenRefine (LODRefine) almost on a daily basis at my job. However, I decided to attend the Blacklight and the GeoHydra workshops. In what would become a recurring theme for me at this conference, both of these tools had direct relevance to my work since the metadata that I create, remediate and otherwise ‘wrangle’, disappears (for me) into these programs and reappears on the public discovery/access side. I wanted to know more about how this process worked, and I was not disappointed. Both workshops gave me a great overview of the function and possibilities of these tools, in particular when it comes to geographic metadata (which is a popular topic both in my work and in libraries more generally at the moment). That evening, back in my hotel room, I was able to get my own installation of Blacklight running on my laptop, which I tweeted about with glee.

The conference schedule included diverse topics which occurred so that the talks built upon each other – whether this was through ingenious planning or serendipity, the result was brilliant. Three areas of discussion really caught my attention and professional imagination: data visualization, working with structured cataloging data/metadata, and handling geographic data and discovery. Some of the tools and resources discussed, particularly in the area of data visualization and structured metadata, I already had experience with; but these talks, like Quick and Easy Data Visualization with Google Visualization API and Google Chart Libraries and Structured Data NOW: seeding schema.org in library systems, still offered many new ideas to this metadata person. Alternatively, some of the talks were on workflows, tools or resources that were very new to me – like PhantomJS+Selenium: Easy Automated Testing of AJAX-y UIs and Queue Programming—How Using Job Queues Can Make the Library Coding World a Better Place . These talks formed the basis for my Code4Lib bucket list of tools and topics that I will be working through this spring and summer. During the conference, the other participants with knowledge complementary to my own were extremely nice and helpful about explaining concepts that I did not understand. I even got to know better some of the systems engineers who work at my own (admittedly, very large and very siloed) institution as well as in the greater New York City area, which was an excellent added benefit of the 2014 Conference. A strong connection between catalogers/metadata librarians and systems librarians/engineers is, I believe, mutually beneficial, and the Code4Lib Conference helped with the creation and strengthening of these connections. Even better, one of the many Twitter discussions during the conference showed that other attendees agreed with the importance of metadata-systems connections. This was an invaluable discussion for me.

Looking towards the future, I am not sure how to improve the Code4Lib Conference experience – it was that amazing. For myself, I hope to become more involved with my local Code4Lib chapter, following up on the topics that were touched on at the conference. I also hope to help support or co-organize a BIBFRAME pre-conference workshop in an upcoming national conference – this idea growing out of the great discussions during the BIBFRAME/Linked Data break-out sessions. During some of the talks, in particular We Are All Disabled! Universal Web Design Making Web Services Accessible for Everyone, the idea of having sign language interpreters at the next Code4Lib Conference was brought up via Twitter, and I believe the idea was added to the 2015 Conference wiki. I would also imagine that the next conference will need a bigger space, since the 2014 Conference was packed and many more who could not attend expressed interest in future events via social media. As my nearly 900 tweets will tell you, I found interacting with the conference speakers and participants via Twitter a great addition to my experience, even considering the issues with the Wi-Fi (which is an obvious area of improvement, but not the fault of the 2014 Conference organizers). Additionally, the tour of the NC State Hunt Library blew my mind, and I wonder if a tour of local technology and/or library hotspots is or should be a regular part of the conference experience.
        
All things considered, the 2014 Code4Lib Conference was absolutely amazing, and I look forward to not only attending the 2015 Conference, but to being more involved with the Code4Lib community. Thank you to both the conference organizers and the sponsors for the opportunity to attend this year. It has positively changed my perspective on both my professional community and my career path.

From: http://www.sheldon-hess.org/coral/2014/04/code4lib-2014-write-up/

I had an enjoyable and educational time at Code4Lib 2014. It was my first time attending any Code4Lib event, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be there, thanks to the Diversity Scholarship sponsored by the Council on Library and Information Resources/Digital Library Federation, EBSCO, ProQuest, and Sumana Harihareswara. Thank you to the sponsors, the scholarship and organizing committees, and everyone else involved with the conference for this amazing learning experience!

Things that went well

I appreciated that the conference was one-track and was recorded. It meant that, except during the pre-conference day, I didn’t have to make any hard decisions about which talks to attend; we all got to attend everything! I think the one-track nature of the conference is particularly important in light of Sumana Harihareswara’s keynote about the value we place on empathy and user-centricity: it’s easy for coders to choose “more technical” sessions and miss talks about accessibility and user experience, which are absolutely vital to what we do, but are often undervalued. I know I was not the only person in the room who learned new and useful information from Cynthia Ng’s talk, so I’m glad that we were all there to benefit from it. I’m also glad it was recorded, because I now have the ability to share it with my Web Team.
In terms of the first-time Code4Lib experience, I am grateful that people warned me about the inevitability of impostor syndrome (and exhaustion), when one attends C4L talks all day. Out of all of the communication I received before conference, that was the second most vital thing, right behind the message, both implicit (e.g. the existence of the newcomer dinners, messages to the email list aimed at newbies) and explicit (e.g. the “how to hack C4L” wiki post, the content of various emails from and conversations with veteran attendees), that new people are welcome and are invited to participate fully. Before conference, just reading over the schedule, I felt completely outclassed–still excited about attending, because these are competencies I want to master, but also really intimidated. All of the welcoming messaging and the references to “the fire hose of information,” with the clear indication that nobody understands everything, calmed me down. I’m still not willing to publicly guess at the percentage of the conference that I completely understood, but I know all of the talks are online, when I need to refer back to them; I really appreciate that.

I was also delighted to have the chance to meet both of our keynote speakers, Sumana Harihareswara and Valerie Aurora, whose keynotes added tremendously to the value of the conference. They are both personal heroes of mine, so I was extra pleased that they took the time to attend sessions and meals and to have conversations with people at the conference! I am grateful to Sumana for all of the time she spent answering questions about Hacker School—and to both of them for running the Allies Workshop as part of the 

LibTechGender pre-conference.

NCSU is amazing! They were great hosts and really nice about answering the questions they must get asked repeatedly. I have so many pictures to share with the building manager of my library!

Suggestions for future conference organizers

In terms of what could be improved about the conference, I know I was not the only person who missed multiple pre-conferences that would have been worth attending. (Yes, I appear to be complaining about too much of a good thing.) I enjoyed the LibTechGender pre-conference, which I helped to plan and execute, and I’d like to believe it contributed in a valuable way to the ongoing conversation about inclusiveness in library technology and leadership; however, because it was a full day, I missed the Summon and Blacklight hackathons as well as the session about test-driven development, all of which would have directly helped with my work. It might not be reasonable to have two full days of pre-conferences—though if the quality and variety this year is representative, perhaps it would be—so perhaps the first day could consist of three sessions? Nine hours of sessions makes for a long day, I know, even with breaks. Maybe limiting pre-conferences to a half day would be a more popular approach. Or maybe we find space for hackathons and longer form tutorial-type content during the conference itself.

I obviously don’t have the solution, but I know a lot of us felt that we missed a lot of potential value on the pre-conference day, even while we got value out of what we were doing. Recording the sessions won’t solve it, but maybe there’s some other way to mitigate that feeling—that reality, actually. It seems like something worth thinking about.

Now, this isn’t so much a suggestion, in terms of something new, but rather an exhortation to continue a good thing: I really appreciated having food available that was safe for me to eat (and still interesting and different each day), as well as the women’s-cut t-shirts. They seem like such little things, but they added so very much to the feeling of inclusiveness and to my comfort at the conference!
Over all…

… I really like this community and this conference, and I could see it easily becoming my home in the library world. I’ve committed to a couple more years of attendance at ALA Midwinter and Annual, but I would like to find a way to make Code4Lib my main conference.

Code4Lib trip report
31 March 2014


As a diversity scholarship recipient, I was afforded the opportunity to attend the 2014 Code4Lib conference in Raleigh, NC. The conference consisted of two and a half days of presentations and one day of preconference workshops. Looking back on the experience, I am impressed by the content of the presentations, the openness of the community, and the overall sense of curiosity and exploration. I learned a great deal and am looking forward to applying the inspiration and motivation that I took away from the conference in my daily work.


Pre-conference

Prior to the start of the conference itself, I attended the “Archival Discovery and Use” pre-conference session. True to its name, Code4Lib has historically been more library-focused, but this session covered topics like the modern relevance of archival finding aids, archival crowdsourcing, and presentation methods for digitized materials. Because librarians and archivists have so many intertwined concerns, I was glad to see the archival community represented.


I would have liked to see more hands-on workshop sessions, particularly targeted at beginner and intermediate skill levels. Activities like the RailsBridge workshop that was offered encourage individuals who might not consider themselves to be “coders” to get involved with the community and technology. Training was an ongoing theme throughout the conference, and intermediate-level training can often be difficult to find, so perhaps the Code4Lib conference is a good venue for that kind of opportunity.


Conference sessions

Many of the conference sessions that I found most useful related to tools that most of us are already familiar with, but applied to new uses. For example, I don’t think I’ll ever look at Google Docs spreadsheets the same way again after Bohyun Kim’s talk, “Quick and Easy Data Visualization with Google Visualization API and Google Chart Libraries.” Similarly, Josh Wilson spoke about the customization possibilities of Google Analytics with in his presentation, “Personalize your Google Analytics Data With Custom Events and Variables.” And although I had used visualization tools like Gephi before, I was amazed by the NYPL Labs work presented by Matt Miller in “Visualizing Library Resources as Networks." 


In light of the discussion around next year’s conference possibly having concurrent sessions (rather than the current model, where there is a single presentation track), I’ve been reflecting on the experience and feel strongly in favor of the one-track model. Although allowing concurrent sessions would mean that more people could present on their work, I found that only having one option both exposed me to content that I would perhaps not have seen otherwise and created a greater sense of community and camaraderie. While I am confident that the organizers would be successful in implementing a different scheduling model, I hope the possible risks of altering the conference in this way are taken fully into account.


Everything else

So many of my favorite things about the conference have very little to do with the content of the presentations. The high spirits throughout the week, the sense of humor, the friendliness of every person I spoke to, and the sense of community make Code4Lib a truly exceptional conference. I was inspired by Valerie Aurora’s closing keynote as well as Bess Sadler’s presentation on training for open source projects. In addition to supporting diversity through these scholarships, the Code4Lib community is one that makes a true effort to be inclusive. It’s exciting to see the group put its money where its mouth is by supporting these scholarships and speakers.


Thanks again to the conference sponsors and scholarship committee, for the opportunity to participate in this conference. Hopefully I’ll see you all again next year in Portland!

1 April 2014


As a new professional in the field, lone digital archivist, and a first timer to the Code4Lib Conference, my experience was incredibly inspiring and enriching. I value Code4Lib’s collective mission of teaching and learning through community, collaboration, and a free exchange of ideas. The conference was unique and unlike any other library or archives conference I have attended. I appreciate the thoughtfulness of planning events to specifically welcome new attendees. The newcomer dinner was not only a great way to meet fellow newbies (and oldtimers) on the evening before the conference, but also provided familiar faces to say hello to the following day. Moreover, Code4Lib resolved my session selecting anxieties, where I always feel like I’ve missed out on yet another important session. The conference is set up so that all attendees will have equal opportunities to view the sessions together in a continuous fashion, in addition to live streams made available to those unable to attend. The conference was jam packed with back to back presentations, lightning talks, and breakout sessions. There was a good balance of interesting topics by insightful speakers, mixed in with scheduled breaks with copious coffee and tea to stay alert and focused throughout the day.

Bright and early Monday morning, I attended the preconference workshop for Railsbridge: Intro to Ruby Programming. The workshop was fast-paced and covered a lot of materials in a short amount of time. The structure of the workshop followed the step-by-step curriculum available on the Railsbridge site – beginning with an overview covering basic Ruby syntax, creating and adding files to Git repository, and ultimately creating a voting system that allows users to vote, view, create, edit, and destroy topics. In the afternoon, I attended the Intro to Git workshop, which covered fundamentals of Git – what it is, the structure, and basic commands for getting started. As a Ruby and Git newbie, I found both workshops to be equally effective and provided a good introduction to each topic.

The conference kicked off with an inspiring keynote talk by Sumana Harihareswara, Senior Technical Writer at Wikimedia Foundation. Sumana’s presentation on usability, empathy, and social justice particularly spoke to me as my focus in my graduate studies often explored the importance of human-centered design to improve user experience, information access, and discoverability. Furthermore, I have been contemplating the Hacker School for some time and her positive experience with the program was immensely motivating - I hope to apply in the near future.

Many of the presentations and lightning talks were made up of discourse on new (to me), innovative, experimental technologies and practices. Some of my favorites include WebSockets for Real-Time and Interactive Interfaces, Visualizing Library Resources as Networks, Dial-A-DPLA, and Adding a Map View to your Blacklight App. I found Bohyun Kim’s Quick/Easy Data Visualization w/ Google Viz API & Chart Library to be useful, as I’m interested in utilizing simple tools to help visualize, make sense of, and see patterns in large data sets. Bess Sadler’s talk on Sustaining your Open Source Project Through Training was empowering as an aspiring library technologist interested in open source development.

The Code4Lib conference was a great learning experience. I am grateful to the generous sponsors - Council on Library and Information Resources/Digital Library Federation, EBSCO, ProQuest, Sumana Harihareswara, and the Scholarship Committee for this incredible opportunity to participate in the 2014 Conference and connect with fellow community members. I am excited to be part of the Code4Lib community and look forward to future collaborations, discourse, and next year’s conference in Portland.

<h1>Code4Lib 2014: Conference Review</h1>
<em>J. (Jenny) Gubernick</em>


<strong>Intro</strong>


I was fortunate to receive a diversity scholarship to help defray the costs of attending Code4Lib 2014 in Raleigh, NC. Although I am still processing the somewhat overwhelming amount of information I absorbed, I suspect that I will look back at this past week as a transformative experience. I pivoted from thinking of myself as "not a real programmer," "lucky to have any job," and that "maybe someday I can do something cool," to thinking of myself as being in a position of great empowerment to learn and do, and being ready to apply my skills to a more complex work. I look forward to continuing to be part of this community in months and years to come.

<strong>Takeaways</strong>


Because I received a gender diversity scholarship, I wanted to give back by attending and helping present at the #libtechgender preconference. This introduced me to individuals in the Code4Lib community who are exceptionally committed to improving diversity not just at this conference, but also in the greater library and technology world. My favorite comment in the workshop: <em>cultivating diversity, tolerance, and acknowledging privilege is a social skill, which we can all improve and practice just like any other skill</em>. The two keynote speeches during the main conference also highlighted the very real gender and racial divides between coders and end users, and the importance of nurturing talent and diversity from within libraries and non-technical staff. In the weeks since the conference, I've volunteered to teach a coding camp for teens over the summer, and to provide mentorship opportunities to a few non-technical coworkers interested in learning to code. I'm excited to see where this energy takes me next.


I have a lot of nerdier takeaways, too: new APIs, libraries, and frameworks to play with, new ideas for small time investment/big return projects like data visualization, and a better understanding of what the intimidating job postings that I've seen actually mean in terms of skill levels and workload. I sent the slides from the talk on web accessibility back to my office and heard that my coworkers had tested the accessibility of our library’s website in real time; my notes from the UX breakout session were also well-received. I even won a book on web development with Clojure, which I've been curious about for a while and am excited to start exploring.


<strong>Suggestions for Code4Lib newcomers</strong>


I was nervous that this might be the kind of place where there are a lot of jerks. It wasn’t. It really wasn’t. Everyone that I sat next to, ate a meal with, chatted with informally, and who presented was invariably friendly and welcoming, and interested in sharing information. So if any past bad experiences or preconceptions with the tech community are holding you back from coming to Code4Lib, please give it a chance. There is a solid code of conduct and there are many allies actively willing to be backup.


There were many semi-structured ways to get to know people at the conference: the newcomer dinner, the tour, the social activities that were planned and open to all on the wiki, sitting with different groups throughout the day’s formal activities, etc. Take advantage of some of those opportunities, while also being willing to forgive yourself for not taking advantage of all opportunities. Self-care is important, and in such an information-overload-heavy environment, taking time for a nap, a quiet walk, or a one-on-one conversation can be just as important as participating in a loud social function or attending a session.

<strong>Suggestions for conference organizers</strong>


At this venue, many rooms were too crowded, without adequate seating or accessible walkways. Many slides were difficult to read. I hope that people with disabilities are explicitly included in the diversity scholarship awardees and future organizer committees, both to make the conference more diverse, and also to help make it more accessible for everyone. One of the talks at this year's conference talked about universal design; it would be great if that inspired the conference to adopt universal design models, too.


Although name badges were helpful, they could have displayed more helpful information: Twitter/IRC handles, preferred pronouns, stickers/badges/word clouds highlighting info such as software, platforms, areas of professional interest, etc. Employer information seemed necessary, yet also problematic: sometimes, I felt conversationally limited by wearing a badge that announced that I worked at a public library.


Perhaps having explicit job seeking/recruitment/resume review sessions would be helpful for attendees looking to broaden their professional horizons. Perhaps having more sessions/hackfests/networking sessions focused on specific software/platforms (aside from preconferences) would help facilitate more meaningful conversations and professional connections, as well.

        As a recipient of Diversity Scholarship for the 9th annual Code4Lib conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, I had an enlightening and incredible experience.

As a “one-man shop” I have limited support for implementing many of these technologies.

        My time at the conference revealed that many libraries are passionately striving to make end-user systems usable, accessible, and transparent. There were numerous presentations that revolved around these ideas, such as using APIs to create data visualizations for displaying library statistics, real-time interactive discovery systems and interfaces, moving away from “list” type listings of holdings to network-node maps, web accessibility for differently abled patrons, and much more. The numerous lightning talks also provided a great wealth of information (all within 5 minutes!)


I was also able to attend the preconference. There were many diverse tracks and “hackfests” for a wide variety of library technologies and tools. However, the track that I enjoyed the most was the #libtechwomen/#libtechgender session. This preconference session explored the difficulties that women and underrepresented voices in tech/librarianship face. I've only had discussions like these in activist/social justice circles from my time as an undergraduate and graduate student. Some of the important take backs include conferences adopting a code of conduct, ensuring safe spaces, mentoring, and ally support. I was also very fortunate to be asked to run a half-hour session on being a good backup which is based out of the backup ribbon project. The greatest take-away was having a very enlightening conversations on these topics, as they may not be necessarily addressed (and at worst ignored) at a tech conference. It is also exciting to see these ideas discussed and hopefully being used within the profession.


        Besides the actual content of the conference, I can’t stress enough how great it was to meet the various librarians and people who work in libraries outside of it. For future conference organizers and attendees I highly suggest continuing the Newcomer Dinner and code4lib Social Activities. During the conference, it can be difficult to talk to other attendees. The meals throughout the day allow people to network with one another; this is an invaluable aspect of any professional conference, but even more so for code4lib. Networking opens opportunities for future collaborations, discussing similar projects (and obstacles) at different institutions, and of course learning from others’ experiences. The tour of NCSU’s Hunt Library was also incredible, and I hope to see future conferences take tours of other libraries and institutions.


From what I understand, this is also the first code4lib that had meals offered throughout the conference. I believe that it is important for future conferences to continue this and make “breaking bread” with fellow coders easier for those with dietary restrictions. I think offering food for attendees with vegetarian, vegan, & gluten-free diets is leaps and bounds beyond other conferences. I would definitely like to see a continuation of this inclusion at future events.


The code4lib conference was an eye-opening experience and I am very grateful to the sponsors and the scholarship committee for providing me with this opportunity. On the way from the airport, I was lucky enough to share a taxi with a fellow codelib conference attendee. We both discussed how this conference was so great, because he said “it’s like being in a room where everyone is speaking the same language and doing the same job as you are.” I felt like this was a great way to sum up the conference. Talking about code and programming can be at times alienating, even with other librarians, but I felt a genuine sense of inclusion and understanding at code4lib.

Diversity Scholarship Trip Report
Code4Lib, 2014
Raleigh, NC
Nabil Kashyap
4/1/14


Coming to my first Code4Lib was significant because when I first began connecting with the group and its resources, I was a freshly-minted graduate in the middle of a career change. By the time I landed in Raleigh, three months into a new job, I was an information professional--more or less.


After graduating last May from library school, I admit to using the Code4Lib website obsessively during my quest for employment; I quickly found the site, wiki, listserv and journal invaluable. There was a level of energy and involvement by users that made it stand out from other, more conventional professional organizations. Plus, the job postings often described exactly the kinds of emerging, interdisciplinary positions I was most interested in. Code4Lib was a network I wanted to be a part of. Miraculously, my search worked out: I was offered a position, though I had not yet started when I finally applied for the diversity scholarship.


What did I hear at Code4Lib 2014? I heard about use cases for specific code libraries like socket.io and D3.js. I heard about upcoming changes to software integral to our library’s stack, straight from the developers. At the grandest level, I heard inspiring calls for change in our practices and workplaces. Code4Lib left me with a lot to chew on, both in terms of ideas for how I might tackle specific problems I happen to be working on and in terms of the social and political implications of my interactions in and around code.


One of my preconceptions was that I would be surrounded by coders and be exposed to open source libraries and ideas for how to implement them. This was clearly the case. In the near term, I will definitely make use of what I learned to help me in my current slough of projects. Thinking a little further out, I was very interested in the cluster of presentations around exposing and reusing more data in our discovery layer, from lightweight linked data implementations to tree maps and network graphs.


Finally, I have a personal interest in political and social issues around digital networked technologies, and I am seeing more and more of an interest in these issues around my campus. It was not what I expected from Code4Lib, but I learned a great deal about how to articulate these issues, how to identify problems and recognize success and how I might facilitate related-events in the near future through the library. I also walk away inspired to stop being bashful and to push my first commit to an open source project.


And from the Laotian we had at Monday’s Newcomer Dinner to phenomenal barbecue, from lurking on the IRC channel to 80s hacker footage on 16mm, Code4Lib tasted better and was way more fun than I intended. It was a pleasure to interact in the conference hall and at the bar afterwards with such a generous and esteemed group of developers, designers, technologists and librarians.


Besides the obvious challenge of limited connectivity and getting presenters set up, I largely felt the conference went smoothly. Internet access is clearly not entirely within ones control. On the other hand, I think being a little more strict about how presenters can present might have been helpful, e.g., maybe requiring uploads prior to speaking, maybe limiting all presentations to web-based interfaces, maybe limiting presenters to pdf’s and supporting live websites. Both Code4Lib volunteers and hotel staff were pretty much excellent and helpful. A far cry from many conferences I’ve attended.


Two other unrelated suggestions came to mind during my time in Raleigh. One is, I wonder whether the order of the presentation proposals could be randomized in the Diebold-O-Tron online voting interface. Because there were so many proposals, I wondered whether the order of the options skewed vote distribution, for instance, otherwise interesting proposals getting less attention because they fell below the scroll. I also felt inspired to work on actual projects but didn’t feel like I had any time to play. The conference worked well as it was, but I wonder if a parallel track, instead of a breakout session or afternoon talk, might be convened to allow those interested to actually play with tools the time and space to do so.

Code4Lib Report

I was recently selected by the Code4Lib community to receive a diversity scholarship to attend the Code4Lib conference in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Code4Lib conference was the perfect place to make new connections with people who aim to make information more accessible through technology. As someone who is in close proximity in technology and usability, I was interested in the new strides taking place in this area. At this conference, I made new contacts for future collaboration and attend talks ranging from Linked Open Data and Google Analytics.

I was very moved by Sumana Harihareswara’s engaging key note speech. Sumana works for the Wikimedia foundation as a technology executive and open source management consultant who leads software development. In her talk, she stressed the importance of usability of the tools and technologies we create for people, even referring to usability as a universal human right. She said that usability is something we need to think of from the beginning when we create a software or a system, not an afterthought. In her words, “We can build arteries better than we can build capillaries.” However, capillaries are where the interesting things actually happen.  She referenced the low amount of eBooks borrowed from the New York public library as a usability problem. Currently, there are over a dozen steps a user must hurdle through in order to borrow a eBook from the New York Public library. For this reason, only 19,000 eBooks are borrowed a year in comparison with the 250,000 books that are borrowed. This ratio is not representative of how users are purchasing eBooks. Industries are making it easier for users to purchase eBooks, so public libraries must make their sites more usable in an effort to do the same.

I didn’t travel far to come to the conference, (DC -> Raleigh), however I was so pleased to meet people who had traveled very long distances to be there. One of the presenters was even from Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria, Egypt. Ingy Morsy presented about annotating PDF books from the Bibliotecha Alexandrina. It was nice to see that the code4lib movement was not only national, but libraries around the world were attempting to make information more accessible through technology.

I learned about the available tools I can use in my work and research by attending this conference. I often use d3 for my information visualization work, but Bohyun Kim’s presentation showed me a simpler alternative, Google visualization, which would be a lot simpler to use in prototyping visualization work. While d3 is more interactive, Google Visualization is a very useful tool when prototyping simple visualizations.

I also really enjoyed the tour of the Hunt Library at North Carolina State University, one of the most incredible libraries I have ever been to. I found myself wishing University of Maryland had a library like that of NC State while I was a undergraduate student. The Hunt library really embodied the premise that the library is a place where people get together and seek information. There was a makerspace room, multimedia rooms with incredible screens, a gaming room, and so vast amounts of colorful open space for students to sit. I was able to see the “Listen to Wikipedia” screen which created different types of music when people edited Wikipedia. People were also able to take pictures of themselves on Instagram tagged “#huntlibrary” and it would appear on the large screen. I later learned that there was a vetting process for these pictures which demonstrates that incorporating social media and technology into your institution comes with its own set of challenges – like vetting bathroom selfies in the library.

I think that all libraries should incorporate the most recent technologies to engage patrons and make information more accessible. Attending the Code4Lib conference made me realize the importance of incorporating technologies in library spaces and the importance of usability of these technologies. Overall, the organizing committee was extremely friendly and welcoming. There was a lunch the first day for the scholarship recipients. I think it was a splendid idea to have lunch for the scholarship recipients, because it was nice to get to know about them and their backgrounds and to exchange contact information.

**What**: It’s a 2 day unconference in Vancouver, BC! A participant-driven meeting featuring lightning talks in the mornings, breakout sessions in the afternoons, with coffee, tea and snacks provided. Lightning talks are brief presentations which are typically 5-10 minutes in length (15 minutes is the maximum) on topics related to library technologies: current projects, tips and tricks, or hacks in the works. Breakout sessions is an opportunity to bring participants together in an ad hoc fashion for a short, yet sustained period of problem solving, software development and fun. In advance of the event, we will gather project ideas in a form available through our wiki and registration pages. Each afternoon the code4libBC participants will review and discuss the proposals, break into groups, and work on some of the projects.

**When**: November 27 and 28, 2014

**Where**: SFU Harbour Centre, Vancouver, BC [map](http://goo.gl/maps/iyC0j)

**Cost**: $20

**Accommodations**: Info coming soon.

**Register**: [here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/second-annual-code4libbc-regional-library-technology-conference-tickets-12988552109)


**Who**: A diverse and open community of library developers and non-developers engaging in effective, collaborative problem-solving through technology.Anyone from the library community who is interested in library technologies are welcome to join and participate, regardless of their department or background: systems and IT, public services, circulation, cataloguing and technical services, archives, digitization and preservation. All are welcome to help set the agenda, define the outcomes and develop the deliverables!

**Why**: Why not? code4libBC is a group of dynamic library technology practitioners throughout the province who want to build new relationships as much as develop new software solutions to problems.

**Tag d'hash**: #c4lbc

title: 'Code4Lib 2015: Call for Proposals'
created: 1411488765
---
Code4Lib 2015 is a loosely-structured conference that provides people working at the intersection of libraries/archives/museums/cultural heritage and technology with a chance to share ideas, be inspired, and forge collaborations. For more information about the Code4Lib community, please visit [http://code4lib.org/about/](http://code4lib.org/about/).

The conference will be held at the Portland Hilton & Executive Tower in Portland, Oregon, from February 9-12, 2015.

**Proposals for Prepared Talks:**

We encourage everyone to propose a talk. 

Prepared talks are 20 minutes (including setup and questions), and should focus on one or more of the following areas:

* Projects you've worked on which incorporate innovative implementation of existing technologies and/or development of new software
* Tools and technologies – How to get the most out of existing tools, standards and protocols (and ideas on how to make them better)
* Technical issues - Big issues in library technology that should be addressed or better understood
* Relevant non-technical issues – Concerns of interest to the Code4Lib community which are not strictly technical in nature, e.g. collaboration, diversity, organizational challenges, etc.

**To Propose a Talk**

* Log in to the Code4Lib wiki and edit the [Prepared Talk wiki page](http://wiki.code4lib.org/2015_Prepared_Talk_Proposals) using the prescribed format. If you are not already registered, follow the instructions to do so.

* Provide a title and brief (500 words or fewer) description of your proposed talk.

* If you so choose, you may also indicate when, if ever, you have presented at a prior Code4Lib conference. This information is completely optional, but it may assist voters in opening the conference to new presenters.

As in past years, the Code4Lib community will vote on proposals that they would like to see included in the program. The top 10 proposals are guaranteed a slot at the conference. The Program Committee will curate the remainder of the program in an effort to ensure diversity in program content and presenters.  Community votes will, of course, still weigh heavily in these decisions.

Presenters whose proposals are selected for inclusion in the program will be guaranteed an opportunity to register for the conference. The standard conference registration fee will still apply.

Proposals can be submitted through **Friday, November 7, 2014 at 5pm PST (GMT−8)**. Voting will start on November 11, 2014 and continue through November 25, 2014. The URL to submit votes will be announced on the Code4Lib website and mailing list and will require an active code4lib.org account to participate. 

The final list of presentations will be announced in early- to mid-December.

- Rebecca Fraimow, rebecca\_fraimow@wgbh.org, NDSR Resident, WGBH
- Casey Davis, casey\_davis@wgbh.org, Project Manager, American
Archive of Public Broadcasting, WGBH

Here’s a story to send shivers down archival spines: when transferring
video files off LTO for the American Archive project, WGBH got an
initial failure rate of 57%. After repeat tries, the rates improved;
still, an unnervingly large percentage of files were never able to be
transferred successfully. Even more unnerving, going public with our
horror story got a big response from other archives using LTO -- it
seems like many institutions are having similarly scary results. What
are the real risks with LTO tape? Are there steps that archives should
be taking to better circumvent those risks? This presentation will share
information about LTO storage failures across archives world and discuss
the process of investigating the problem at WGBH by testing different
methods of data retrieval from LTO (direct and networked downloads,
individual file retrieval and bulk data dump, use of LTO 4 and LTO 6
decks) and using checksum comparisons and file analysis and
characterization tools such as ffprobe, mediainfo and exiftool to
analyze failed files. We'll also present whatever results we’ve managed
to turn up by the time of Code4Lib!

title: Annotations as Linked Data with Fedora4 and Triannon (a Real Use Case for RDF!)
created: 1417819277
---
- Rob Sanderson, azaroth@stanford.edu, Stanford University Libraries
- Naomi Dushay, ndushay@stanford.edu, Stanford University Libraries

Annotations on content resources allow users to contribute knowledge
within the digital repository space. W3C Open Annotation provides a
comprehensive model for web annotation on all types of content, using
Linked Data as a fundamental framework. Annotation clients generate
instances of this model, typically using a JSON serialization, but need
to store that data somewhere using a standard interaction pattern so
that best of breed clients, servers, and data can be mixed and matched.

Stanford is using Fedora4 for managing Open Annotations, via a
middleware component called Triannon. Triannon receives the JSON data
from the annotation client, and uses the Linked Data Platform API
implementation in Fedora4 to create, retrieve, update and delete the
constituent resources. Triannon could be easily modified to use other
LDP implementations, or could be modified to work with linked data other
than annotations.

title: A Semantic Makeover for CMS Data
created: 1417818966
---
- Bill Levay, @wjlevay, wjlevay@gmail.com, Linked Jazz Project, Code4Lib first-timer

How can we take semi-structured but messy metadata from a repository like CONTENTdm and transform it into rich linked data? Working with metadata from Tulane’s Hogan Jazz Archive Photography Collection, the Linked Jazz Project used Open Refine and Python scripts to tease out proper names, match them with name authority URIs, and specify FOAF relationships between musicians who appear together in photographs. Additional RDF triples were created for any dates associated with the photos, and for those images with place information we employed GeoNames URIs. Historical images and data that were siloed can now interact with other datasets, like Linked Jazz’s rich set of names and personal relationships, and can be visualized ([see prototype visualization](http://linkedjazz.org/tulane/)) or otherwise presented on the web in any number of ways.

Library Outside the Library (LOL) group is piloting a more automated
approach to letting our users tell us which materials they find
particularly stunning. Armed with a Raspberry Pi, a barcode scanner, and
some bits of kit that flash and glow, we have ventured into the foreign

- Jason Casden, jmcasden@ncsu.edu, NCSU Libraries
- Bret Davidson, bddavids@ncsu.edu, NCSU Libraries

The Code4Lib community has produced an increasingly impressive
collection of open source software over the last decade, but much of
this creative work remains out of reach for large portions of the
library community. Do the relatively privileged institutions represented
by a majority of Code4Lib participants have a professional
responsibility to support the adoption of their innovations?

Drawing from old and new software packaging and distribution approaches
(from freeware to Docker), we will propose extending the open source
software values of collaboration and transparency to include the wide
and affordable distribution of software. We believe this will not only
simplify the process of sharing our applications within the Code4Lib
community, but also make it possible for less well resourced
institutions to actually use our software. We will identify areas of
need, present our experiences with the users of our own open source
projects, discuss our attempts to go beyond open source, and make an
argument for the internal value of supporting and encouraging a vibrant
library ecosystem.

- Eben English, eenglish [at] bpl.org, Boston Public Library

Another day, another library reinventing the book-viewer wheel. When
will the madness end? This talk will explore the current landscape of
book-viewer/page-turner applications for digital library systems with an
eye towards helping you make the right decision for your project. We'll
look at some the major players on the market (such as Internet Archive
BookReader, Wellcome Player, Mirador, and WDL-Viewer to name a few) and
compare them based on a number of criteria: feature sets, mobile/tablet
friendliness, ease of integration, code health, test coverage, "market
share" (number of implementers), and other important factors. We'll look
at the results of ACTUAL USABILITY TESTS to see what features users
REALLY want in a book-viewer, and how each app measures up.

We'll also discuss important recent trends (such as the IIIF
Presentation API, ReadersFirst, and NYPL's Library Simplified
initiative) that have the potential to shape the book-viewer development
landscape in the immediate future. Which page-turner applications are
best poised to adopt/integrate/leverage these emerging standards? Which
will become obsolete? This talk has the answers you need.

created: 1417819308
---
- Axa Mei Liauw, aliauw@princeton.edu, Princeton University Library
- Kevin Reiss, kr2@princeton.edu, Princeton University Library

Bootstrap is awesome! It allows for quick and easy front-end development
without demanding too much time with the design of the user interface. A
framework like Bootstrap can also help libraries address one of our top
usability problems: wild inconsistency of styles and layouts across our
own in-house applications and websites.

However, what if you do not want to compromise your creativity and make
your project visually stand out? With enough Sass or Less knowledge it
is possible to highly customize Bootstrap to fit your needs, but in the
end you still end up with your design and code buying into Bootstrap's
markup and design conventions, which are not always what you want.
Sometimes you simply want to start with a clean slate and not fight the
framework and use only the components and features you need.

In that case, build your own Bootstrap! In this talk we will discuss
techniques for using some of the emerging tools from the front-end
development and design communities to create a maintainable, modular
in-house Sass toolkit that we are implementing within a variety of tools
including Drupal, Rails applications, in house PHP applications, as well
as within vendor solutions like Libguides and ILLiad. Some specific
tools we will discuss are Grunt, Bower, and Sass tools like Singularity,
Breakpoint, and Bourbon.

Library, UC (c4l 2012 presenter)

[<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/scollett/consuming-big-openlinkeddatappv3-1">slides</a>]

Increasingly, authoritative datasets of interest to libraries (subjects,
names, classifications, etc.) are are available in bulk, exposed as
linked open data. Unfettered access can allow libraries to aggregate,
connect, and augment data in new ways that will benefit users. This talk
will describe our exploratory experience integrating bulk data from the
Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) into HathiTrust metadata to
improve discovery and collection management.

Authoritative data is not static - datasets change with new
contributions and re-clustering, resulting in new identifier
relationships. We will describe the challenges this presents with
accessing, processing, and syncing our metadata with a massive, complex
linked dataset. We will talk about our technical approach to navigating
an ecosystem of identifiers and mitigating cached identifier drift
between systems as authority data shifts. We aim to spark conversation
about data accessibility and the relationships between local,
consortial, and authoritative metadata as the library community moves
beyond “Hello, world” linked data examples to integrating this data at
scale into existing systems.

New managers are often promoted without receiving management training,
yet management is not something you just figure out. The experience of
being expected to know how to manage, yet not being trained to do so
often results in new managers feeling isolated and unsure how to move
from making to managing. In this talk I’ll focus on my own managerial
experience of designing and leading an archival tech team in a small
independent archives. Topics covered will include hiring, delegating,
creating a team culture, and leading people whose specialized knowledge
exceeds your own. The talk take-aways should be applicable to managers

So you want to expose your digital content in your discovery interface,
integrated with the data from your ILS? How do you make the best
information user searchable? How do you present complete, up to date
search results with a minimum of duplicate entries?

At Stanford, we have these cases and more:

- digital content with no metadata in ILS
- digital content for metadata in ILS
- digital content with its own metadata derived from ILS metadata.

We will describe our efforts to accommodate multiple updatable metadata
sources for materials in the ILS and our Digital Object Repository while
presenting users with reduced duplication in SearchWorks. Included will
be some failures, some successes, and an honest assessment of where we
are now.

- Kevin S. Clarke, ksclarke@gmail.com, Digital Library Programmer,
UCLA

There are a lot of exciting ways to deploy a software stack nowadays.
Many of our library systems are fully virtualized. Docker is a
compelling alternative, and there are also cloud options like Amazon's
EC2. This talk will introduce Packer.io, a tool for creating identical
machine images for multiple platforms (e.g., Docker, VMWare, VirtualBox,
EC2, GCE, OpenStack, et al.) all from a single source configuration. It
works well with Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt, and plain old Bash scripts.
And, it's designed to be scriptable so that builds can be automated.
This presentation will show how easy it is to use Packer.io to bring up
a set of related services like Fedora 4, Grinder (for stress testing),
and Graphite (for charting metrics). As an added value, all the
buzzwords in this proposal will be defined and explained!

to get good performance, how to deal with indexing failures, how to
schedule it all to keep the data up-to-date, and some things you can do

Libraries are not neutral repositories of knowledge. Library
classification systems and search technologies tend to reflect the
inequalities, biases, ethnocentrism, and power imbalances of the
societies in which they are built [1]. How might we better resist these
tendencies in the library software we create? This talk will examine
some qualities of feminist HCI (pluralism, self-disclosure,
participation, ecology, advocacy, and embodiment) [2] through the lens
of library software.

The Digital Public Library of America aggregates metadata for over 8
million objects from more than 24 direct partners, or Hubs, using its
Metadata Application Profile (MAP), an RDF metadata application profile
based on the Europeana Data Model. After working with the initial system
for harvesting, mapping and enhancing our Hub’s metadata for a year, we
realized that it was inadequate for working with data at this scale.
There were architectural issues; it was opaque to non-developer and
partner staff; there were inadequate tools for quality assurance and
analysis; and the system was unaware that it was working with RDF data.
As the network of Hubs expanded and we ingested more metadata, it became
harder and harder to know when or why a harvest, a mapping task, or an
enrichment went wrong because the tools for quality assurance were
largely inadequate.

The DPLA Content and Technology teams decided to develop a new system
from the ground up to address those problems. Development of Heidrun,
the internal version of the new system, started in October 2014.
Heidrun’s goals are to make it easier for us to harvest and map metadata
from various sources and in variety of schemas to the DPLA MAP, to
better enrich that metadata using external data sources, and to actively
involve our partners in the ingestion process through access to better
QA tools. Heidrun and its componentry are built on Ruby on Rails,
Blacklight, and ActiveTriples. Our presentation will give some
background on our design principles and processes used during
development, the architecture of the system, and its functionality. We
plan to release a version of Heidrun and its components as a generalized
metadata aggregation system for use by DPLA Hubs and others working to
aggregate cultural heritage metadata.

title: Helping Google (and scholars, researchers, educators, & the public) find archival
  audio
created: 1417819064

- Anne Wootton, anne@popuparchive.org, Pop Up Archive
(www.popuparchive.org)

Culturally significant digital audio collections are hard to discover on
the web. There are major barriers keeping this valuable media from
scholars, researchers, and the general public:

Audio is opaque: you can’t picture sound, or skim the words in a
recording. Audio is hard to share: there’s no text to interact with.
Audio is not text: but since text is the medium of the web, there’s no
path for audiences to find content-rich audio. Audio metadata is
inconsistent and incomplete.

At Pop Up Archive, we're helping solve this problem making the spoken
word searchable. We began as a UC-Berkeley School of Information
Master's thesis to provide better access to recorded sound for audio
producers, journalists, and historians. Today, Pop Up Archive processes
thousands of hours of sound from all over the web to create automatic,
timestamped transcripts and keywords, working with media companies and
institutions like NPR, KQED, HuffPost Live, Princeton, and Stanford.
We're building collections of sound from journalists, media
organizations, and oral history archives from around the world. Pop Up
Archive is supported by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the
National Endowment for the Humanities, and 500 Startups.

Modern technology has made it easier than ever for parents employed in
technical environments to keep up with work at all hours and in all
locations. This makes it possible to work a flexible schedule, but also
may lead to problems with work/life balance and furthering unreasonable
expectations about working hours. Add to that shifting gender roles and
limited paid parental leave in the United States and you have potential
for burnout and a certainty for anxiety. It raises the additioal
question of whether the “always connected” mindset puts up a barrier to
some populations who otherwise might be better represented in open
source and library technology communities.

This presentation will address tools that are useful for working parents
in technical library positions, and share some lessons learned about
using these tools while maintaining a reasonable work/life balance. We
will consider a question that Karen Coyle raised back in 1996: “What if
the thousands of hours of graveyard shift amateur hacking wasn't really
the best way to get the job done? That would be unthinkable.”

For those who are able to take an extended parental leave, we will
present strategies for minimizing the impact to your career and your
employer. For those (particularly in the United States) who are only
able to take a short leave will require different strategies. Despite
different levels of preparation, all are useful exercises in succession
planning and making a stronger workplace and future ability to work a
flexible schedule through reviewing workloads, cross-training personnel,
hiring contract replacements, and creative divisions of labor. Such
preparation makes work better for everyone, kids or no kids or
caretakers of any kind.

- Coral Sheldon-Hess, coral@sheldon-hess.org

Reading code is a necessary part of becoming a better developer. It
gives you more experience and more insight into How Things Are (or
Aren't) Done; it builds your intuition about how to solve problems with
code; and it increases your confidence that you, too, can tackle
whatever technological problems you're facing.

But you don't have to read code alone! (Which is good. It's really not
fun to read code alone.)

In late 2014, a group of librarians formed two Code Clubs, inspired by
[this talk by Saron](http://bloggytoons.com/code-club/) (of Bloggytoons
fame). I'd like to tell you about how we've structured our Code Clubs,
what has gone well, what we've learned, and what you need to do to form
your own Code Club. I'll share a list of the codebases we've looked at,
too, to help you get your own Code Club off the ground!

- Jessie Keck, jkeck@stanford.edu, Stanford University Libraries
- Jack Reed, pjreed@stanford.edu, Stanford University Libraries

With more and more content from our digital repositories making their
way into our discovery environments we quickly realize that we’re
repeatedly re-inventing the wheel when it comes to creating “Viewers”
for these digital objects. With various different types of viewers
necessary (books, images, audio, video, geospatial data, etc) the burden
of getting these viewers into various environments (topic guides, blogs,
catalogs, etc) becomes exponential.

In this talk we’ll discuss how Stanford University Libraries implemented
an oEmbed service to create an extensible viewer framework for all of
its digital content. Using this service we’ve been able to easily
integrate viewers into various discovery applications as well as make it
easy for end users who discover our objects to easily embed customized
versions into their own websites and blogs.

title: 'Our $50,000 Problem: Why Library School?'
created: 1417819320
---
- Jennie Rose Halperin, jhalperin@safaribooksonline.com

57 library schools in the United States are churning out approximately
100 graduates per year, many with debt upwards of $50,000. According to
ONet, [84% of library jobs in the US require an MLS.](http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2011/is-the-united-states-training-too-many-librarians-or-too-few-part-1/)
The library profession is 92% white and 82% female and entry-level librarians can [expect to make $32,500 per year](http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/library-workers-facts-figures/).

Contrasted with developers, who are almost [90% male](http://www.ncwit.org/blog/did-you-know-demographics-technical-women)
and can expect to make [$70,000 in an entry-level position,](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2011/06/01/best-entry-level-jobs/)
these numbers are dismal.

According to a recent survey, the top skill that outgoing library
students want to know is “programming” and yet many MLS programs still
consider Microsoft Word an essential technology skill.

What is going on here? Why do we accept this fate, where mostly female
debt-burdened professionals continue to be thrown onto the work force
without the education their expensive degrees promised?

As a community we need to come together to stop this cycle. We need to
provide better support and mentorship to diversify and keep the
profession relevant and help librarianship move into the future it
deserves.

This talk will walk through the challenges of navigating a hostile
employment environment as well as present models for better development
and future state imagining.

- Erin White, erwhite@vcu.edu, Virginia Commonwealth University -
first-time presenter

Managing projects is one thing, but managing people is another. Whether
we’re hired as managers or grow “organically” into management roles,
sometimes technical people end up leading technical teams (gasp!). I’ll
talk about lessons I’ve learned about hiring, retaining, and working
long-term and day-to-day with highly tech-competent humans. I’ll also
talk about navigating the politics of libraryland, juggling different
types of projects, and working with constrained budgets to make good
things and keep talented people engaged.

title: Refinery — An open source locally deployable web platform for the analysis
  of large document collections
created: 1417819260
---
**TALK HAS BEEN CANCELLED**

- Daeil Kim, The New York Times, daeil.kim@nytimes.com

Refinery is an open source web platform for the analysis of large
unstructured document collections. It extracts meaningful semantic
themes within documents also known as "topics" which can be thought of
as word clouds composed of terms that highly co-occur with one another.
Once this semantic index is formed, one can extract relevant documents
related to these topics and further refine their contents through a
summarization process that allows users to search for phrases that are
relevant to them within the corpus. The goal of Refinery is to make this
whole process easier and to provide some of the latest scalable versions
of these learning algorithms in an intuitive web-based interface.
Refinery is also meant to be run locally, thus bypassing the need for
securing document collections over the internet. The talk will go
through some of the technologies involved and a demo of the app.

title: 'You Gotta Keep ''em Separated: The Case for "Bento Box" Discovery Interfaces'
created: 1417819288
---
- Jason Thomale, jason.thomale@unt.edu, University of North Texas
Libraries

I know, I know--proposing a talk about Resource Discovery is like, *so*
2010.

The thing is, practically all of us--in academic libraries at
least--have a similar set up for discovery, with just a few variations,
and so talking about it still seems useful. Stop me if this sounds
familiar. You've got a single search box on the library homepage as a
starting point for discovery. And it's probably a tabbed affair, with an
option for searching the catalog for books, an option for searching a
discovery service for articles, an option for searching databases, and
maybe a few others. Maybe you have an option to search everything at
once--probably the default, if you have it. And, if you're a crazy
hepcat, maybe you *only* have your one search that searches everything,
with no tabs.

Now, the question is, for your "everything" search, are you doing a
combined list of results, or are you doing it bento-box style, with a
short results list from each category displayed in its own compartment?

At UNT, we've been holding off on implementing an "everything" search,
for various reasons. One reason is that the evidence for either style
hasn't been very clear. There's this persistent paradox that we just
can't reconcile: users tell us, through word and action, that they
prefer searching Google, yet, libraries aren't Google, and there are
valid design reasons why we shouldn't try to oversimplify our discovery
interfaces to be like Google. And there's user data that supports both
sides.

Holding off on making this decision has granted us 2 years of data on
how people use our tabbed search interface that does *not* include an
"everything" search. Recently I conducted a thorough analysis of this
data--specifically the usage and query data for our catalog and
discovery system (Summon). And I think it helps make the case for a
bento box style discovery interface. To be clear, it isn't exactly the
smoking gun that I was hoping for, but the picture it paints I think is
telling. At the very least, it points away from a combined-results
approach.

I'm proposing a talk discussing the data we've collected, the trends
we've seen, and what I think it all means--plus other reasons that we're
jumping on the "bento box" discovery bandwagon and why I think "bento
box" is at this point the path that least sells our souls.

Slides (including notes) are available <a href="https://github.com/jthomale/c4l2015-presentation">here</a>.

A written report covering the analysis discussed during the presentation in more detail is available <a href="http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc499075/">here.</a>

title: Your Chocolate is in My Peanut Butter! Mixing up Content and Presentation Layers
  to Build Smarter Books in Browsers with RDFa, Schema.org, and Linked Data Topics
created: 1417819012
---
- Jason A. Clark [@jaclark], Head, Library Informatics & Computing,
Montana State University, jaclark@montana.edu
- Scott W. H. Young [@hei\_scott], Digital Initiatives Librarian,
Montana State University, swyoung@montana.edu

Common methods of publishing book content have focused on various
implementations of existing technologies such as LaTeX, Markdown, and
.epub. A common theme within this development has been the separation of
presentation layers and content layers. What if there was another way?
In responding to that question, we’ll look at our local @msulibrary
prototype software funded by an IMLS Sparks! Innovation grant for
presenting books inside of web browsers
(https://github.com/jasonclark/bib-template). Our talk will focus on the
tools and technologies of open web publishing. We’ll consider the
strange and wonderful benefits of integrating the presentation layer and
content layer using semantic RDFa HTML5 markup, and we’ll demonstrate
how describing and displaying books within an open web model impacts
discovery, eBook production, and machine-readability.

Our session will include:

- The benefits of using RDFa, Schema.org, and linked data models for
book production
- How structured data models for book content can turn your webpage
into your API
- Analyze the effects of this practice for machine-understanding, SEO,
and UX
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this model as it applies
to a range of book genres, including web book prototypes for fiction
and poetry.

title: Your code does not exist in a vacuum
created: 1417818764
---
- Becky Yoose, yoosebec at grinnell dot edu, Grinnell College

“If you have something to say, then say it in code…” - Sebastian Hammer,
code4lib 2009

In its 10 year run, code4lib has covered the spectrum of libtech
development, from search to repositories to interfaces. However, during
this time there has been little discussion about this one little fact
about development - code does not exist in a vacuum.

Like the comment above, code has something to say. A person’s or
organization’s culture and beliefs influences code in all steps of the
development cycle. What development method you use, tools, programming
languages, licenses - everything is interconnected with and influenced
by the philosophies, economics, social structures, and cultural beliefs
of the developer and their organization/community.

This talk will discuss these interconnections and influences when one
develops code for libraries, focusing on several development practices
(such as “Fail Fast, Fail Often” and Agile) and licensing choices (such
as open source) that libtech has either tried to model or incorporate
into mainstream libtech practices. It’ll only scratch the surface of the
many influences present in libtech development, but it will give folks a
starting point to further investigate these connections at their own
organizations and as a community as a whole.

tl;dr - this will be a messy theoretical talk about technology and
libraries. No shiny code slides, no live demos. You might come out of
this talk feeling uncomfortable. Your code does not exist in a vacuum.
Then again, you don’t exist in a vacuum either.

title: 2015 Code of Conduct
created: 1422730825
---
Code4Lib seeks to provide a welcoming, fun, and safe community and
conference experience as well as an ongoing community for everyone. We do not
tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery
(including sexual) is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks,
or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list.

Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens another person or
group, or produces an unsafe environment.  It includes offensive verbal
comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity,
gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, age, religious beliefs, sexual or discriminatory images
in public spaces (including online), deliberate intimidation, stalking,
following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of 
talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

Conflict Resolution
-------------------

1. Initial Incident

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
    or have any other concerns, __and you feel comfortable speaking with
    the offender__, please inform the offender that he/she/ze has affected you 
    negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the 
    accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by having 
    that initial discussion.
    
    Code4Lib recognizes that there are many reasons speaking directly to
    the offender may not be workable for you (including but not limited to
    unfamiliarity with the conference or its participants, [lack of spoons](http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/wpress/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/),
    and concerns for personal safety). If you don't feel comfortable 
    speaking directly with the offender for any reason, skip straight to 
    step 2.

2. Escalation 

    If the offender insists that he/she/ze did not offend, if offender is
    actively harassing you, or if direct engagement is not a good option
    for you at this time, then you will need a third party to step in.

    If you are at a conference or other event, find an event organizer or
    staff person, who should be listed [on the wiki](http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Main_Page).
    If you can't find an event organizer, there will be other staff 
    available to help if the situation calls for immediate action.

    If you are in the #code4lib IRC, the zoia command to list people
    designated as channel helpers is **@helpers**. At most times, there is at least one helper in the channel.

    For the listserv, you have a free-for-all for public messages; however,
    the listserv does have a maintainer, [Eric Lease Morgan](http://www3.nd.edu/~emorgan/).

3. Wider community response to Incident:

    If the incident doesn't pass the first step (discussion reveals offense
    was unintentional, apologies said, public note or community is informed
    of resolution), then there's not much the community can do at this point
    since the incident was resolved without outside intervention.

    If incident results in corrective action, the community should support
    the decision made by the Help in Step 2 if they choose corrective action,
    like ending a talk early or banning from the listserv, as well as
    support those harmed by the incident, either publicly or privately
    (whatever individuals are comfortable with).

    If the Help in Step 2 run into issues implementing the CoC, then the
    Help should come to the community with these issues and the community
    should revise the CoC as they see fit.

    In Real Life people will have opinions about how the CoC is enforced.
    People will argue that a particular decision was unfair, and others will
    say that it didn't go far enough. We can't stop people having
    opinions, but what we could do is have constructive discussions
    that lead to something tangible (affirmation of decision, change in CoC,
    modify decision, etc,).

Sanctions
---------

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender,
expulsion from the Code4Lib event, or banning the offender from a chatroom
or mailing list.

Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:

* warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports
will result in other sanctions
* requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical
proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
* early termination of a talk that violates the policy
* not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
* not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at
the event
* immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the
harasser holds requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future Code4lib
events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
* requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
* banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a
certain time period)
* publishing an account of the harassment

Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges, and will
help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
safe for the duration of the event. Code4Lib IRC volunteers can be identified
by issuing the `@helpers` command to the #code4lib bot named "zoia".

If an incident occurs, please use the following contact information:

* **Conference organizers:** Tom Johnson, 360-961-7721 or Evviva Weinraub, 617-909-2913
* **Hilton Portland & Executive Tower:** 503-226-1611
* **Portland Police Department**: 503-823-0000
* **Portland Women's Crisis Line (24/7):** 503-235-5333 (or toll-free: 888-235-5333) 24/7
* **Radio Cab:** 503-227-1212
* **IRC channel administrators:** anarchivist, mistym, mjgiarlo, ruebot; or enter `@helpers` in the IRC channel

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues,
conference-related social events, community gatherings, and online communication channels.

We value your participation in the Code4Lib community, and your efforts to
keep Code4Lib a safe and friendly space for all participants!

The [Code4Lib 2016](http://2016.code4lib.org) Philadelphia Committee is pleased to announce that we have finalized the dates and location of the [2016 conference](http://2016.code4lib.org).

The 2016 conference will be held from March 7 through March 10 in the Old City District of Philadelphia.  This location puts conference attendees within easy walking distance of many of Philadelphia’s historical treasures, including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the Constitution Center, and the house where Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence. Attendees will also be a very short distance from the Delaware River waterfront and will be a short walk from numerous excellent restaurants.

As we’ll be reserving almost all of the space within the hotel for our conference (both rooms and conference spaces), Code4Lib 2016 will have the tight-knit community feel we know is important.

More details to come soon; in the meantime, the Keynote Committee is gearing up to open submissions for the conference keynote speaker, so be sure to contact them at [pacella@gmail.com](mailto:pacella@gmail.com) for more information, or you can nominate a keynote speaker at [http://wiki.code4lib.org/2016_Invited_Speakers_Nominations](http://wiki.code4lib.org/2016_Invited_Speakers_Nominations).  

Also, our Sponsorship Committee is actively looking for sponsors for 2016, so please contact the committee via [Shaun Ellis](mailto:shaune@princeton.edu) to learn about all the ways your organization can help sponsor our 2016 conference.

It’s shaping up to be a great conference this year, and there will be lots more opportunities to volunteer. Our team is looking forward to seeing you on March 7!

[Creating Tomorrow’s Technologists: Contrasting Information Technology Curriculum in North American Library and Information Science Graduate Programs against Code4lib Job Listings](http://monicamaceli.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Maceli_JELIS_2015.pdf) by [Monica Maceli](http://monicamaceli.com/) recently appeared in the *Journal of Education for Library and Information Science* 56.3 (DOI:10.12783/issn.2328-2967/56/3/3). As the title states, it studies listings on [jobs.code4lib.org](http://jobs.code4lib.org/):

> This research study explores technology-related course offerings in ALA-accredited library and information science (LIS) graduate programs in North America. These data are juxtaposed against a text analysis of several thousand LIS-specific technology job listings from the Code4lib jobs website. Starting in 2003, as a popular library technology mailing list, Code4lib has since expanded to an annual conference in the United States and a job-posting website. The study found that database and web design/development topics continued to dominate course offerings with diverse sub-topics covered. Strong growth was noted in the area of user experience but a lack of related jobs for librarians  was  identified.  Analysis  of  the  job  listings  revealed  common  technology-centric librarian and non-librarian job titles, as well as frequently correlated requirements for technology skillsets relating to the popular foci of web design/development and metadata. Finally, this study presents a series of suggestions for LIS educators in order that they continue to keep curriculum aligned with current technology employment requirements.

Code4Lib 2017 is a loosely-structured conference that provides people working at the intersection of libraries/archives/museums/cultural heritage and technology with a chance to share ideas, be inspired, and forge collaborations. For more information about the Code4Lib community, please visit [http://code4lib.org/about/](http://code4lib.org/about/). 

The conference will be held at the [Luskin Conference Center at UCLA](http://luskinconferencecenter.ucla.edu/), from March 6, 2017 - March 9, 2017.  More information about Code4lib 2017 will be coming soon.  

We encourage all members of the Code4Lib community to submit a proposal for a prepared talk. Prepared talks should focus on one or more of the following areas: 

-Projects you've worked on which incorporate innovative implementation of existing technologies and/or development of new software 
- Tools and technologies – How to get the most out of existing tools, standards, and protocols (and ideas on how to make them better) 
- Technical issues – Big issues in library technology that are worthy of community attention or development 
- Relevant non-technical issues – Concerns of interest to the Code4Lib community which are not strictly technical in nature, e.g. collaboration, diversity, organizational challenges, etc. 

This year, in order to provide increased opportunities for a diversity of speakers and topics, we'll be soliciting 10, 15, and 20 minute talks. You'll be asked to indicate which talk lengths you would be willing to accommodate for your proposal. We are also considering holding a poster session at this year's conference. If you would be interested in presenting your topic as a poster, please indicate so on the form.
[https://goo.gl/forms/GbM0jmSdXFkRdHAr2](https://goo.gl/forms/GbM0jmSdXFkRdHAr2)

In addition to "traditional" presentations and posters, we plan to include a panel session this year. If you have a topic you'd like to suggest for a panel, and are willing to work with the Program Committee to organize / recruit for the session, please use the following form.
[https://goo.gl/forms/q2KbVcO4ntkh6bPp1](https://goo.gl/forms/q2KbVcO4ntkh6bPp1)

As in past years, the Code4Lib community will vote on proposals that they would like to see included in the program. The top 10 proposals are guaranteed a slot of their preferred length at the conference. The Program Committee will curate the remainder of the program in an effort to ensure diversity in program content and presenters. Community votes will, of course, still weigh heavily in these decisions. 

Presenters whose proposals are selected for inclusion in the program will have conference registration slots held for them (up to 2 speakers per talk). In addition, panel participants will have registration slots held. The standard conference registration fee will apply. 

Proposals can be submitted through November 7, 2016 at midnight PST (GMT−8). Voting will start on November 16, 2016 and continue through December 7, 2016. The URL to submit votes will be announced on the Code4Lib website and mailing list and will require an active code4lib.org account to participate. The final list of presentations will be announced in December.  

Thank you, 
The Code4Lib 2017 Program Committee
